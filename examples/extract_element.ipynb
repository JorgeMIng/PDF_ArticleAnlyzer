As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications.'"

Training is computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes, and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the final results. We present a replication study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results highlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise questions about the source of recently reported improvements. We release our models and code. 1   </p></div>\n",

Training is computationally expensive, limiting the amount of tuning that can be done, and is often done with private training data of varying sizes, limiting our ability to measure the effects of the modeling advances.</p><p>We present a replication study of BERT pretraining <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>, which includes a careful evaluation of the effects of hyperparmeter tuning and training set size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained and propose an improved recipe for training BERT models, which we call RoBERTa, that can match or exceed the performance of all of the post-BERT methods. Our modifications are simple, they include: (1) training the model longer, with bigger batches, over more data; (2) removing the next sentence prediction objective; (3) training on longer sequences; and (4) dynamically changing the masking pattern applied to the training data. We also collect a large new dataset (CC-NEWS) of comparable size to other privately used datasets, to better control for training set size effects.</p><p>When controlling for training data, our improved training procedure improves upon the published BERT results on both GLUE and SQuAD. When trained for longer over additional data, our model achieves a score of 88.5 on the public GLUE leaderboard, matching the 88.4 reported by <ref target=\"#b48\" type=\"bibr\">Yang et al. (2019)</ref>. Our model establishes a new state-of-the-art on 4/9 of the GLUE tasks: MNLI, QNLI, RTE and STS-B. We also match state-of-the-art results on SQuAD and RACE. Overall, we re-establish that BERT's masked language model training objective is competitive with other recently proposed training objectives such as perturbed autoregressive language modeling <ref target=\"#b48\" type=\"bibr\">(Yang et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type=\"bibr\">2</ref> In summary, the contributions of this paper are: (1) We present a set of important BERT design choices and training strategies and introduce alternatives that lead to better downstream task performance; (2) We use a novel dataset, CC-NEWS, and confirm that using more data for pretraining further improves performance on downstream tasks; (3) Our training improvements show that masked language model pretraining, under the right design choices, is competitive with all other recently published methods. We release our model, pretraining and fine-tuning code implemented in PyTorch <ref target=\"#b31\" type=\"bibr\">(Paszke et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>\n",

The MLM objective is a cross-entropy loss on predicting the masked tokens. BERT uniformly selects 15% of the input tokens for possible replacement. Of the selected tokens, 80% are replaced with [MASK ], 10% are left unchanged, and 10% are replaced by a randomly selected vocabulary token.</p><p>In the original implementation, random masking and replacement is performed once in the beginning and saved for the duration of training, although in practice, data is duplicated so the mask is not always the same for every training sentence (see Section 4.1).</p><p>Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) NSP is a binary classification loss for predicting whether two segments follow each other in the original text. Positive examples are created by taking consecutive sentences from the text corpus. Negative examples are created by pairing segments from different documents. Positive and negative examples are sampled with equal probability.</p><p>The NSP objective was designed to improve performance on downstream tasks, such as Natural Language Inference <ref target=\"#b4\" type=\"bibr\">(Bowman et al., 2015)</ref>, which require reasoning about the relationships between pairs of sentences.</p></div>\n",

The GLUE organizers provide training and development data splits as well as a submission server and leaderboard that allows participants to evaluate and compare their systems on private held-out test data.</p><p>For the replication study in Section 4, we report results on the development sets after finetuning the pretrained models on the corresponding singletask training data (i.e., without multi-task training or ensembling). Our finetuning procedure follows the original BERT paper <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In Section 5 we additionally report test set results obtained from the public leaderboard. These results depend on a several task-specific modifications, which we describe in Section 5.1.</p><p>SQuAD The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) provides a paragraph of context and a question. The task is to answer the question by extracting the relevant span from the context.

We keep the model architecture fixed. 7 Specifically, we begin by training BERT models with the same configuration as BERT BASE (L = 12, H = 768, A = 12, 110M params).</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"4.1\">Static vs. Dynamic Masking</head><p>As discussed in Section 2, BERT relies on randomly masking and predicting tokens. The original BERT implementation performed masking once during data preprocessing, resulting in a single static mask. To avoid using the same mask for each training instance in every epoch, training data was duplicated 10 times so that each sequence is masked in 10 different ways over the 40 epochs of training. Thus, each training sequence was seen with the same mask four times during training.</p><p>We compare this strategy with dynamic masking where we generate the masking pattern every time we feed a sequence to the model. This becomes crucial when pretraining for more steps or with larger datasets. Results Table <ref type=\"table\">1</ref> compares the published BERT BASE results from <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">Devlin et al. (2019)</ref> to our reimplementation with either static or dynamic masking. We find that our reimplementation with static masking performs similar to the original BERT model, and dynamic masking is comparable or slightly better than static masking. Given these results and the additional efficiency benefits of dynamic masking, we use dynamic masking in the remainder of the experiments.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"4.2\">Model Input Format and Next Sentence Prediction</head><p>In the original BERT pretraining procedure, the model observes two concatenated document segments, which are either sampled contiguously from the same document (with p = 0.5) or from distinct documents. In addition to the masked language modeling objective, the model is trained to predict whether the observed document segments come from the same or distinct documents via an auxiliary Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) loss.</p><p>The NSP loss was hypothesized to be an important factor in training the original BERT model. <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">Devlin et al. (2019)</ref> observe that removing NSP hurts performance, with significant performance degradation on QNLI, MNLI, and SQuAD 1.1. However, some recent work has questioned the necessity of the NSP loss <ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">(Lample and Conneau, 2019;</ref><ref target=\"#b48\" type=\"bibr\">Yang et al., 2019;</ref><ref target=\"#b18\" type=\"bibr\">Joshi et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>To better understand this discrepancy, we compare several alternative training formats:</p><p>• SEGMENT-PAIR+NSP: This follows the original input format used in BERT <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>, with the NSP loss. Each input has a pair of segments, which can each contain multiple natural sentences, but the total combined length must be less than 512 tokens. • SENTENCE-PAIR+NSP: Each input contains a pair of natural sentences, either sampled from a contiguous portion of one document or from separate documents. Since these inputs are significantly shorter than 512 tokens, we increase the batch size so that the total number of tokens remains similar to SEGMENT-PAIR+NSP. We retain the NSP loss.</p><p>• FULL-SENTENCES: Each input is packed with full sentences sampled contiguously from one or more documents, such that the total length is at most 512 tokens. Inputs may cross document boundaries. When we reach the end of one document, we begin sampling sentences from the next document and add an extra separator token between documents. We remove the NSP loss.</p><p>• DOC-SENTENCES: Inputs are constructed similarly to FULL-SENTENCES, except that they may not cross document boundaries. Inputs sampled near the end of a document may be shorter than 512 tokens, so we dynamically increase the batch size in these cases to achieve a similar number of total tokens as FULL-SENTENCES. We remove the NSP loss.</p><p>Results Table <ref type=\"table\">2</ref> shows results for the four different settings. We first compare the original SEGMENT-PAIR input format from <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">Devlin et al. (2019)</ref> to the SENTENCE-PAIR format; both formats retain the NSP loss, but the latter uses single sentences. We find that using individual sentences hurts performance on downstream tasks, which we hypothesize is because the model is not able to learn long-range dependencies.</p><p>We next compare training without the NSP loss and training with blocks of text from a single document (DOC-SENTENCES). We find that this setting outperforms the originally published BERT BASE results and that removing the NSP loss matches or slightly improves downstream task performance, in contrast to <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">Devlin et al. (2019)</ref>. It is possible that the original BERT implementation may only have removed the loss term while still retaining the SEGMENT-PAIR input format.</p><p>Finally we find that restricting sequences to come from a single document (DOC-SENTENCES) performs slightly better than packing sequences from multiple documents (FULL-SENTENCES). However, because the DOC-SENTENCES format results in variable batch sizes, we use FULL-SENTENCES in the remainder of our experiments for easier comparison with related work.</p></div>\n",

Instead of full words, BPE relies on subwords units, which are extracted by performing statistical analysis of the training corpus.</p><p>BPE vocabulary sizes typically range from 10K-100K subword units. However, unicode characters can account for a sizeable portion of this vocabulary when modeling large and diverse corpora, such as the ones considered in this work. <ref target=\"#b34\" type=\"bibr\">Radford et al. (2019)</ref> introduce a clever implementation of BPE that uses bytes instead of unicode characters as the base subword units. Using bytes makes it possible to learn a subword vocabulary of a modest size (50K units) that can still encode any input text without introducing any \"unknown\" tokens. <ref type=\"bibr\">8</ref> Large batch training can improve training efficiency even without large scale parallel hardware through gradient accumulation, whereby gradients from multiple mini-batches are accumulated locally before each optimization step.

Following <ref target=\"#b34\" type=\"bibr\">Radford et al. (2019)</ref>, we instead consider training BERT with a larger byte-level BPE vocabulary containing 50K subword units, without any additional preprocessing or tokenization of the input.

( <ref type=\"formula\">2019</ref>) BPE achieving slightly worse end-task performance on some tasks. Nevertheless, we believe the advantages of a universal encoding scheme outweighs the minor degredation in performance and use this encoding in the remainder of our experiments.

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"5\">RoBERTa</head><p>In the previous section we propose modifications to the BERT pretraining procedure that improve end-task performance. We now aggregate these improvements and evaluate their combined impact. We call this configuration RoBERTa for Robustly optimized BERT approach. Specifically, RoBERTa is trained with dynamic masking (Section 4.1), FULL-SENTENCES without NSP loss (Section 4.2), large mini-batches (Section 4.3) and a larger byte-level BPE (Section 4.4).</p><p>Additionally, we investigate two other important factors that have been under-emphasized in previous work: (1) the data used for pretraining, and (2) the number of training passes through the data. For example, the recently proposed XLNet architecture <ref target=\"#b48\" type=\"bibr\">(Yang et al., 2019</ref>) is pretrained using nearly 10 times more data than the original BERT <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>. It is also trained with a batch size eight times larger for half as many optimization steps, thus seeing four times as many sequences in pretraining compared to BERT.</p><p>To help disentangle the importance of these factors from other modeling choices (e.g., the pretraining objective), we begin by training RoBERTa following the BERT LARGE architecture (L = 24, H = 1024, A = 16, 355M parameters). We pretrain for 100K steps over a comparable BOOK-CORPUS plus WIKIPEDIA dataset as was used in   <ref target=\"#b48\" type=\"bibr\">Yang et al. (2019)</ref>, respectively. Complete results on all GLUE tasks can be found in the Appendix. <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">Devlin et al. (2019)</ref>. We pretrain our model using 1024 V100 GPUs for approximately one day.</p><p>Results We present our results in Table <ref target=\"#tab_5\" type=\"table\">4</ref>. When controlling for training data, we observe that RoBERTa provides a large improvement over the originally reported BERT LARGE results, reaffirming the importance of the design choices we explored in Section 4.</p><p>Next, we combine this data with the three additional datasets described in Section 3.2. We train RoBERTa over the combined data with the same number of training steps as before (100K). In total, we pretrain over 160GB of text. We observe further improvements in performance across all downstream tasks, validating the importance of data size and diversity in pretraining. <ref type=\"bibr\">9</ref> Finally, we pretrain RoBERTa for significantly longer, increasing the number of pretraining steps from 100K to 300K, and then further to 500K. We again observe significant gains in downstream task performance, and the 300K and 500K step models outperform XLNet LARGE across most tasks. We note that even our longest-trained model does not appear to overfit our data and would likely benefit from additional training.</p><p>In the rest of the paper, we evaluate our best RoBERTa model on the three different benchmarks: GLUE, SQuaD and RACE. Specifically we consider RoBERTa trained for 500K steps over all five of the datasets introduced in Section 3.2.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"5.1\">GLUE Results</head><p>For GLUE we consider two finetuning settings. In the first setting (single-task, dev) we finetune RoBERTa separately for each of the GLUE tasks, using only the training data for the corresponding task. We consider a limited hyperparameter sweep for each task, with batch sizes ∈ {16, 32} and learning rates ∈ {1e−5, 2e−5, 3e−5}, with a linear warmup for the first 6% of steps followed by a linear decay to 0. We finetune for 10 epochs and perform early stopping based on each task's evaluation metric on the dev set. The rest of the hyperparameters remain the same as during pretraining. In this setting, we report the median development set results for each task over five random initializations, without model ensembling.</p><p>In the second setting (ensembles, test), we compare RoBERTa to other approaches on the test set via the GLUE leaderboard. While many submissions to the GLUE leaderboard depend on multitask finetuning, our submission depends only on single-task finetuning. For RTE, STS and MRPC we found it helpful to finetune starting from the MNLI single-task model, rather than the baseline pretrained RoBERTa. We explore a slightly wider hyperparameter space, described in the Appendix, and ensemble between 5 and 7 models per task.  Task-specific modifications Two of the GLUE tasks require task-specific finetuning approaches to achieve competitive leaderboard results. QNLI: Recent submissions on the GLUE leaderboard adopt a pairwise ranking formulation for the QNLI task, in which candidate answers are mined from the training set and compared to one another, and a single (question, candidate) pair is classified as positive <ref type=\"bibr\">(Liu et al., 2019b,a;</ref><ref target=\"#b48\" type=\"bibr\">Yang et al., 2019)</ref>. This formulation significantly simplifies the task, but is not directly comparable to BERT <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>. Following recent work, we adopt the ranking approach for our test submission, but for direct comparison with BERT we report development set results based on a pure classification approach. WNLI: We found the provided NLI-format data to be challenging to work with. Instead we use the reformatted WNLI data from Super-GLUE <ref target=\"#b43\" type=\"bibr\">(Wang et al., 2019a)</ref>, which indicates the span of the query pronoun and referent. We finetune RoBERTa using the margin ranking loss from <ref target=\"#b20\" type=\"bibr\">Kocijan et al. (2019)</ref>. For a given input sentence, we use spaCy <ref type=\"bibr\">(Honnibal and Montani, 2017)</ref> to extract additional candidate noun phrases from the sentence and finetune our model so that it assigns higher scores to positive referent phrases than for any of the generated negative candidate phrases. One unfortunate consequence of this formulation is that we can only make use Results We present our results in Table <ref target=\"#tab_7\" type=\"table\">5</ref>. In the first setting (single-task, dev), RoBERTa achieves state-of-the-art results on all 9 of the GLUE task development sets. Crucially, RoBERTa uses the same masked language modeling pretraining objective and architecture as BERT LARGE , yet consistently outperforms both BERT LARGE and XLNet LARGE . This raises questions about the relative importance of model architecture and pretraining objective, compared to more mundane details like dataset size and training time that we explore in this work.</p><p>In the second setting (ensembles, test), we submit RoBERTa to the GLUE leaderboard and achieve state-of-the-art results on 4 out of 9 tasks and the highest average score to date. This is especially exciting because RoBERTa does not depend on multi-task finetuning, unlike most of the other top submissions. We expect future work may further improve these results by incorporating more sophisticated multi-task finetuning procedures.</p></div>\n",

These results illustrate the importance of these previously overlooked design decisions and suggest that BERT's pretraining objective remains competitive with recently proposed alternatives.</p><p>We additionally use a novel dataset, CC-NEWS, and release our models and code for pretraining and finetuning at: https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq.</p></div><figure xml:id=\"fig_0\" xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head/><label/><figDesc>of the positive training examples, which excludes over half of the provided training examples. 10 10 While we only use the provided WNLI training data, our</figDesc></figure>\n",

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><p>Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions -something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art finetuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.</p></div>\n",

First, single-layer representations were learned using word vectors <ref target=\"#b103\" type=\"bibr\">[MCCD13,</ref><ref target=\"#b122\" type=\"bibr\">PSM14]</ref> and fed to task-specific architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations and contextual state were used to form stronger representations <ref target=\"#b47\" type=\"bibr\">[DL15,</ref><ref target=\"#b102\" type=\"bibr\">MBXS17,</ref><ref target=\"#b120\" type=\"bibr\">PNZtY18]</ref> (though still applied to task-specific architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [VSP + 17] have been directly fine-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-specific architectures <ref target=\"#b132\" type=\"bibr\">[RNSS18,</ref><ref target=\"#b43\" type=\"bibr\">DCLT18,</ref><ref target=\"#b65\" type=\"bibr\">HR18]</ref>.</p><p>This last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension, question answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures and algorithms [RSR + 19, LOG + 19, YDY + 19, LCG + 19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while the architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-specific datasets and task-specific fine-tuning: to achieve strong performance on a desired task typically requires fine-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands of examples specific to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.</p><p>First, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the applicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing anything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story. For many of these tasks it is difficult to collect a large supervised training dataset, especially when the process must be repeated for every new task.</p><p>Second, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data fundamentally grows with the expressiveness of the model and the narrowness of the training distribution. This can create problems for the pre-training plus fine-tuning paradigm, where models are designed to be large to absorb information during pre-training, but are then fine-tuned on very narrow task distributions. For instance [HLW + 20] observe that larger models do not necessarily generalize better out-of-distribution. There is evidence that suggests that the generalization achieved under this paradigm can be poor because the model is overly specific to the training distribution and does not generalize well outside it [YdC + 19, MPL19]. Thus, the performance of fine-tuned models on specific benchmarks, even when it is nominally at human-level, may exaggerate actual performance on the underlying task [GSL + 18, NK19]. Third, humans do not require large supervised datasets to learn most language tasks -a brief directive in natural language (e.g. \"please tell me if this sentence describes something happy or something sad\") or at most a tiny number of demonstrations (e.g. \"here are two examples of people acting brave; please give a third example of bravery\") is often Figure <ref target=\"#fig_11\" type=\"figure\">1</ref>.1: Language model meta-learning. During unsupervised pre-training, a language model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities. It then uses these abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task. We use the term \"in-context learning\" to describe the inner loop of this process, which occurs within the forward-pass upon each sequence. The sequences in this diagram are not intended to be representative of the data a model would see during pre-training, but are intended to show that there are sometimes repeated sub-tasks embedded within a single sequence. Figure <ref target=\"#fig_11\" type=\"figure\">1</ref>.2: Larger models make increasingly efficient use of in-context information. We show in-context learning performance on a simple task requiring the model to remove random symbols from a word, both with and without a natural language task description (see Sec. 3.9.2). The steeper \"in-context learning curves\" for large models demonstrate improved ability to learn a task from contextual information. We see qualitatively similar behavior across a wide range of tasks.</p><p>sufficient to enable a human to perform a new task to at least a reasonable degree of competence. Aside from pointing to a conceptual limitation in our current NLP techniques, this adaptability has practical advantages -it allows humans to seamlessly mix together or switch between many tasks and skills, for example performing addition during a lengthy dialogue. To be broadly useful, we would someday like our NLP systems to have this same fluidity and generality.</p><p>One potential route towards addressing these issues is meta-learning 1 -which in the context of language models means the model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities at training time, and then uses those abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task (illustrated in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_11\" type=\"figure\">1</ref>.1). Recent work [RWC + 19] attempts to do this via what we call \"in-context learning\", using the text input of a pretrained language model as a form of task specification: the model is conditioned on a natural language instruction and/or a few demonstrations of the task and is then expected to complete further instances of the task simply by predicting what comes next.</p><p>While it has shown some initial promise, this approach still achieves results far inferior to fine-tuning -for example [RWC + 19] achieves only 4% on Natural Questions, and even its 55 F1 CoQa result is now more than 35 points behind the state of the art. Meta-learning clearly requires substantial improvement in order to be viable as a practical method of solving language tasks. Another recent trend in language modeling may offer a way forward. In recent years the capacity of transformer language models has increased substantially, from 100 million parameters <ref target=\"#b132\" type=\"bibr\">[RNSS18]</ref>, to 300 million parameters <ref target=\"#b43\" type=\"bibr\">[DCLT18]</ref>, to 1.5 billion parameters [RWC + 19], to 8 billion parameters <ref type=\"bibr\">[SPP +</ref> 19], 11 billion parameters [RSR + 19], and finally 17 billion parameters <ref target=\"#b152\" type=\"bibr\">[Tur20]</ref>. Each increase has brought improvements in text synthesis and/or downstream NLP tasks, and there is evidence suggesting that log loss, which correlates well with many downstream tasks, follows a smooth trend of improvement with scale <ref type=\"bibr\">[KMH + 20]</ref>. Since in-context learning involves absorbing many skills and tasks within the parameters of the model, it is plausible that in-context learning abilities might show similarly strong gains with scale.</p><p>Figure <ref target=\"#fig_11\" type=\"figure\">1</ref>.3: Aggregate performance for all 42 accuracy-denominated benchmarks While zero-shot performance improves steadily with model size, few-shot performance increases more rapidly, demonstrating that larger models are more proficient at in-context learning. See Figure <ref target=\"#fig_1\" type=\"figure\">3</ref>.8 for a more detailed analysis on SuperGLUE, a standard NLP benchmark suite.</p><p>In this paper, we test this hypothesis by training a 175 billion parameter autoregressive language model, which we call GPT-3, and measuring its in-context learning abilities. Specifically, we evaluate GPT-3 on over two dozen NLP datasets, as well as several novel tasks designed to test rapid adaptation to tasks unlikely to be directly contained in the training set. For each task, we evaluate GPT-3 under 3 conditions: (a) \"few-shot learning\", or in-context learning where we allow as many demonstrations as will fit into the model's context window (typically 10 to 100), (b) \"one-shot learning\", where we allow only one demonstration, and (c) \"zero-shot\" learning, where no demonstrations are allowed and only an instruction in natural language is given to the model. GPT-3 could also in principle be evaluated in the traditional fine-tuning setting, but we leave this to future work. Figure <ref target=\"#fig_11\" type=\"figure\">1</ref>.2 illustrates the conditions we study, and shows few-shot learning of a simple task requiring the model to remove extraneous symbols from a word. Model performance improves with the addition of a natural language task description, and with the number of examples in the model's context, K. Few-shot learning also improves dramatically with model size. Though the results in this case are particularly striking, the general trends with both model size and number of examples in-context hold for most tasks we study. We emphasize that these \"learning\" curves involve no gradient updates or fine-tuning, just increasing numbers of demonstrations given as conditioning.</p><p>Broadly, on NLP tasks GPT-3 achieves promising results in the zero-shot and one-shot settings, and in the the few-shot setting is sometimes competitive with or even occasionally surpasses state-of-the-art (despite state-of-the-art being held by fine-tuned models). For example, GPT-3 achieves 81.5 F1 on CoQA in the zero-shot setting, 84.0 F1 on CoQA in the one-shot setting, 85.0 F1 in the few-shot setting. Similarly, GPT-3 achieves 64.3% accuracy on TriviaQA in the zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting, the last of which is state-of-the-art relative to fine-tuned models operating in the same closed-book setting.</p><p>GPT-3 also displays one-shot and few-shot proficiency at tasks designed to test rapid adaption or on-the-fly reasoning, which include unscrambling words, performing arithmetic, and using novel words in a sentence after seeing them defined only once. We also show that in the few-shot setting, GPT-3 can generate synthetic news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from human-generated articles.</p><p>At the same time, we also find some tasks on which few-shot performance struggles, even at the scale of GPT-3. This includes natural language inference tasks like the ANLI dataset, and some reading comprehension datasets like RACE or QuAC. By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3's strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we hope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed.</p><p>A heuristic sense of the overall results can be seen in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_11\" type=\"figure\">1</ref>.3, which aggregates the various tasks (though it should not be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in itself).</p><p>We also undertake a systematic study of \"data contamination\" -a growing problem when training high capacity models on datasets such as Common Crawl, which can potentially include content from test datasets simply because such content often exists on the web. In this paper we develop systematic tools to measure data contamination and quantify its distorting effects. Although we find that data contamination has a minimal effect on GPT-3's performance on most datasets, we do identify a few datasets where it could be inflating results, and we either do not report results on these datasets or we note them with an asterisk, depending on the severity.</p><p>In addition to all the above, we also train a series of smaller models (ranging from 125 million parameters to 13 billion parameters) in order to compare their performance to GPT-3 in the zero, one and few-shot settings. Broadly, for most tasks we find relatively smooth scaling with model capacity in all three settings; one notable pattern is that the gap between zero-, one-, and few-shot performance often grows with model capacity, perhaps suggesting that larger models are more proficient meta-learners.</p><p>Finally, given the broad spectrum of capabilities displayed by GPT-3, we discuss concerns about bias, fairness, and broader societal impacts, and attempt a preliminary analysis of GPT-3's characteristics in this regard.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our approach and methods for training GPT-3 and evaluating it. Section 3 presents results on the full range of tasks in the zero-, one-and few-shot settings. Section 4 addresses questions of data contamination (train-test overlap). Section 5 discusses limitations of GPT-3. Section 6 discusses broader impacts. Section 7 reviews related work and Section 8 concludes.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"2\">Approach</head><p>Our basic pre-training approach, including model, data, and training, is similar to the process described in [RWC + 19], with relatively straightforward scaling up of the model size, dataset size and diversity, and length of training. Our use of in-context learning is also similar to [RWC + 19], but in this work we systematically explore different settings for learning within the context. Therefore, we start this section by explicitly defining and contrasting the different settings that we will be evaluating GPT-3 on or could in principle evaluate GPT-3 on. These settings can be seen as lying on a spectrum of how much task-specific data they tend to rely on. Specifically, we can identify at least four points on this spectrum (see Figure <ref target=\"#fig_28\" type=\"figure\">2</ref>.1 for an illustration):</p><p>• Fine-Tuning (FT) has been the most common approach in recent years, and involves updating the weights of a pre-trained model by training on a supervised dataset specific to the desired task. Typically thousands to hundreds of thousands of labeled examples are used. The main advantage of fine-tuning is strong performance on many benchmarks. The main disadvantages are the need for a new large dataset for every task, the potential for poor generalization out-of-distribution <ref target=\"#b109\" type=\"bibr\">[MPL19]</ref>, and the potential to exploit spurious features of the training data [GSL + 18, NK19], potentially resulting in an unfair comparison with human performance. In this work we do not fine-tune GPT-3 because our focus is on task-agnostic performance, but GPT-3 can be fine-tuned in principle and this is a promising direction for future work.</p><p>• Few-Shot (FS) is the term we will use in this work to refer to the setting where the model is given a few demonstrations of the task at inference time as conditioning [RWC + 19], but no weight updates are allowed. As shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_28\" type=\"figure\">2</ref>.1, for a typical dataset an example has a context and a desired completion (for example an English sentence and the French translation), and few-shot works by giving K examples of context and completion, and then one final example of context, with the model expected to provide the completion. We typically set K in the range of 10 to 100 as this is how many examples can fit in the model's context window (n ctx = 2048). The main advantages of few-shot are a major reduction in the need for task-specific data and reduced potential to learn an overly narrow distribution from a large but narrow fine-tuning dataset. The main disadvantage is that results from this method have so far been much worse than state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. Also, a small amount of task specific data is still required. As indicated by the name, few-shot learning as described here for language models is related to few-shot learning as used in other contexts in ML [HYC01, VBL + 16] -both involve learning based on a broad distribution of tasks (in this case implicit in the pre-training data) and then rapidly adapting to a new task.</p><p>• One-Shot (1S) is the same as few-shot except that only one demonstration is allowed, in addition to a natural language description of the task, as shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_11\" type=\"figure\">1</ref>. The reason to distinguish one-shot from few-shot and zero-shot (below) is that it most closely matches the way in which some tasks are communicated to humans. For example, when asking humans to generate a dataset on a human worker service (for example Mechanical Turk), it is common to give one demonstration of the task. By contrast it is sometimes difficult to communicate the content or format of a task if no examples are given.</p><p>Figure <ref target=\"#fig_28\" type=\"figure\">2</ref>.1: Zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot, contrasted with traditional fine-tuning. The panels above show four methods for performing a task with a language model -fine-tuning is the traditional method, whereas zero-, one-, and few-shot, which we study in this work, require the model to perform the task with only forward passes at test time. We typically present the model with a few dozen examples in the few shot setting. Exact phrasings for all task descriptions, examples and prompts can be found in Appendix G.</p><p>• Zero-Shot (0S) is the same as one-shot except that no demonstrations are allowed, and the model is only given a natural language instruction describing the task. This method provides maximum convenience, potential for robustness, and avoidance of spurious correlations (unless they occur very broadly across the large corpus of pre-training data), but is also the most challenging setting. In some cases it may even be difficult for humans to understand the format of the task without prior examples, so this setting is in some cases \"unfairly hard\". For example, if someone is asked to \"make a Figure <ref target=\"#fig_28\" type=\"figure\">2</ref>.1 shows the four methods using the example of translating English to French. In this paper we focus on zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot, with the aim of comparing them not as competing alternatives, but as different problem settings which offer a varying trade-off between performance on specific benchmarks and sample efficiency.</p><p>We especially highlight the few-shot results as many of them are only slightly behind state-of-the-art fine-tuned models.</p><p>Ultimately, however, one-shot, or even sometimes zero-shot, seem like the fairest comparisons to human performance, and are important targets for future work. Table <ref target=\"#tab_2\" type=\"table\">2</ref>.1: Sizes, architectures, and learning hyper-parameters (batch size in tokens and learning rate) of the models which we trained. All models were trained for a total of 300 billion tokens.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"2.1\">Model and Architectures</head><p>We use the same model and architecture as GPT-2 [RWC + 19], including the modified initialization, pre-normalization, and reversible tokenization described therein, with the exception that we use alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in the layers of the transformer, similar to the Sparse Transformer <ref target=\"#b38\" type=\"bibr\">[CGRS19]</ref>. To study the dependence of ML performance on model size, we train 8 different sizes of model, ranging over three orders of magnitude from 125 million parameters to 175 billion parameters, with the last being the model we call GPT-3. Previous work <ref type=\"bibr\">[KMH + 20]</ref> suggests that with enough training data, scaling of validation loss should be approximately a smooth power law as a function of size; training models of many different sizes allows us to test this hypothesis both for validation loss and for downstream language tasks.</p><p>Table <ref target=\"#tab_2\" type=\"table\">2</ref>.1 shows the sizes and architectures of our 8 models. Here n params is the total number of trainable parameters, n layers is the total number of layers, d model is the number of units in each bottleneck layer (we always have the feedforward layer four times the size of the bottleneck layer, d ff = 4 * d model ), and d head is the dimension of each attention head. All models use a context window of n ctx = 2048 tokens. We partition the model across GPUs along both the depth and width dimension in order to minimize data-transfer between nodes. The precise architectural parameters for each model are chosen based on computational efficiency and load-balancing in the layout of models across GPU's. Previous work <ref type=\"bibr\">[KMH + 20]</ref> suggests that validation loss is not strongly sensitive to these parameters within a reasonably broad range.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"2.2\">Training Dataset</head><p>Datasets for language models have rapidly expanded, culminating in the Common Crawl dataset 2 [RSR + 19] constituting nearly a trillion words. This size of dataset is sufficient to train our largest models without ever updating on the same sequence twice. However, we have found that unfiltered or lightly filtered versions of Common Crawl tend to have lower quality than more curated datasets. Therefore, we took 3 steps to improve the average quality of our datasets:</p><p>(1) we downloaded and filtered a version of CommonCrawl based on similarity to a range of high-quality reference corpora, (2) we performed fuzzy deduplication at the document level, within and across datasets, to prevent redundancy and preserve the integrity of our held-out validation set as an accurate measure of overfitting, and (3) we also added known high-quality reference corpora to the training mix to augment CommonCrawl and increase its diversity.</p><p>Details of the first two points (processing of Common Crawl) are described in Appendix A. For the third, we added several curated high-quality datasets, including an expanded version of the WebText dataset [RWC + 19], collected by scraping links over a longer period of time, and first described in <ref type=\"bibr\">[KMH + 20]</ref>, two internet-based books corpora (Books1 and Books2) and English-language Wikipedia.</p><p>Table <ref target=\"#tab_2\" type=\"table\">2</ref>.2 shows the final mixture of datasets that we used in training. The CommonCrawl data was downloaded from 41 shards of monthly CommonCrawl covering 2016 to 2019, constituting 45TB of compressed plaintext before filtering and 570GB after filtering, roughly equivalent to 400 billion byte-pair-encoded tokens. Note that during training, datasets are not sampled in proportion to their size, but rather datasets we view as higher-quality are sampled more frequently, such that CommonCrawl and Books2 datasets are sampled less than once during training, but the other datasets are sampled 2-3 times. This essentially accepts a small amount of overfitting in exchange for higher quality training data. that are drawn from a given dataset, which we intentionally do not make proportional to the size of the dataset. As a result, when we train for 300 billion tokens, some datasets are seen up to 3.4 times during training while other datasets are seen less than once.</p><p>A major methodological concern with language models pretrained on a broad swath of internet data, particularly large models with the capacity to memorize vast amounts of content, is potential contamination of downstream tasks by having their test or development sets inadvertently seen during pre-training. To reduce such contamination, we searched for and attempted to remove any overlaps with the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper.</p><p>Unfortunately, a bug in the filtering caused us to ignore some overlaps, and due to the cost of training it was not feasible to retrain the model. In Section 4 we characterize the impact of the remaining overlaps, and in future work we will more aggressively remove data contamination.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"2.3\">Training Process</head><p>As found in <ref type=\"bibr\">[KMH + 20,</ref><ref target=\"#b106\" type=\"bibr\">MKAT18]</ref>, larger models can typically use a larger batch size, but require a smaller learning rate. We measure the gradient noise scale during training and use it to guide our choice of batch size <ref target=\"#b106\" type=\"bibr\">[MKAT18]</ref>. Table <ref target=\"#tab_2\" type=\"table\">2</ref>.1 shows the parameter settings we used. To train the larger models without running out of memory, we use a mixture of model parallelism within each matrix multiply and model parallelism across the layers of the network. All models were trained on V100 GPU's on part of a high-bandwidth cluster provided by Microsoft. Details of the training process and hyperparameter settings are described in Appendix B.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"2.4\">Evaluation</head><p>For few-shot learning, we evaluate each example in the evaluation set by randomly drawing K examples from that task's training set as conditioning, delimited by 1 or 2 newlines depending on the task. For LAMBADA and Storycloze there is no supervised training set available so we draw conditioning examples from the development set and evaluate on the test set. For Winograd (the original, not SuperGLUE version) there is only one dataset, so we draw conditioning examples directly from it.</p><p>K can be any value from 0 to the maximum amount allowed by the model's context window, which is n ctx = 2048 for all models and typically fits 10 to 100 examples. Larger values of K are usually but not always better, so when a separate development and test set are available, we experiment with a few values of K on the development set and then run the best value on the test set. For some tasks (see Appendix G) we also use a natural language prompt in addition to (or for K = 0, instead of) demonstrations.</p><p>On tasks that involve choosing one correct completion from several options (multiple choice), we provide K examples of context plus correct completion, followed by one example of context only, and compare the LM likelihood of each completion. For most tasks we compare the per-token likelihood (to normalize for length), however on a small number of datasets (ARC, OpenBookQA, and RACE) we gain additional benefit as measured on the development set by normalizing by the unconditional probability of each completion, by computing</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_0\">P (completion|context) P (completion|answer context) ,</formula><p>where answer context is the string \"Answer: \" or \"A: \" and is used to prompt that the completion should be an answer but is otherwise generic.</p><p>On tasks that involve binary classification, we give the options more semantically meaningful names (e.g. \"True\" or \"False\" rather than 0 or 1) and then treat the task like multiple choice; we also sometimes frame the task similar to what is done by [RSR + 19] (see Appendix G) for details.</p><p>On tasks with free-form completion, we use beam search with the same parameters as [RSR + 19]: a beam width of 4 and a length penalty of α = 0.6. We score the model using F1 similarity score, BLEU, or exact match, depending on what is standard for the dataset at hand.</p><p>Final results are reported on the test set when publicly available, for each model size and learning setting (zero-, one-, and few-shot). When the test set is private, our model is often too large to fit on the test server, so we report results on the development set. We do submit to the test server on a small number of datasets (SuperGLUE, TriviaQA, PiQa) where we were able to make submission work, and we submit only the 200B few-shot results, and report development set results for everything else.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3\">Results</head><p>In Figure <ref target=\"#fig_1\" type=\"figure\">3</ref>.1 we display training curves for the 8 models described in Section 2. For this graph we also include 6 additional extra-small models with as few as 100,000 parameters. As observed in <ref type=\"bibr\">[KMH + 20]</ref>, language modeling performance follows a power-law when making efficient use of training compute. After extending this trend by two more orders of magnitude, we observe only a slight (if any) departure from the power-law. One might worry that these improvements in cross-entropy loss come only from modeling spurious details of our training corpus. However, we will see in the following sections that improvements in cross-entropy loss lead to consistent performance gains across a broad spectrum of natural language tasks. Below, we evaluate the 8 models described in Section 2 (the 175 billion parameter parameter GPT-3 and 7 smaller models) on a wide range of datasets. We group the datasets into 9 categories representing roughly similar tasks.</p><p>In Section 3.1 we evaluate on traditional language modeling tasks and tasks that are similar to language modeling, such as Cloze tasks and sentence/paragraph completion tasks. In Section 3.2 we evaluate on \"closed book\" question answering tasks: tasks which require using the information stored in the model's parameters to answer general knowledge questions. In Section 3.3 we evaluate the model's ability to translate between languages (especially one-shot and few-shot). In Section 3.4 we evaluate the model's performance on Winograd Schema-like tasks.

GPT-3 2.7B outperforms the SOTA 17B parameter Turing-NLG <ref target=\"#b152\" type=\"bibr\">[Tur20]</ref> in this setting, and GPT-3 175B advances the state of the art by 18%. Note zero-shot uses a different format from one-shot and few-shot as described in the text.</p><p>and <ref target=\"#b152\" type=\"bibr\">[Tur20]</ref>) and argue that \"continuing to expand hardware and data sizes by orders of magnitude is not the path forward\". We find that path is still promising and in a zero-shot setting GPT-3 achieves 76% on LAMBADA, a gain of 8% over the previous state of the art.</p><p>LAMBADA is also a demonstration of the flexibility of few-shot learning as it provides a way to address a problem that classically occurs with this dataset. Although the completion in LAMBADA is always the last word in a sentence, a standard language model has no way of knowing this detail. It thus assigns probability not only to the correct ending but also to other valid continuations of the paragraph. This problem has been partially addressed in the past with stop-word filters [RWC + 19] (which ban \"continuation\" words). The few-shot setting instead allows us to \"frame\" the task as a cloze-test and allows the language model to infer from examples that a completion of exactly one word is desired. We use the following fill-in-the-blank format:</p><p>Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend . → Bob George bought some baseball equipment, a ball, a glove, and a . →</p><p>When presented with examples formatted this way, GPT-3 achieves 86.4% accuracy in the few-shot setting, an increase of over 18% from the previous state-of-the-art. We observe that few-shot performance improves strongly with model size. While this setting decreases the performance of the smallest model by almost 20%, for GPT-3 it improves accuracy by 10%. Finally, the fill-in-blank method is not effective one-shot, where it always performs worse than the zero-shot setting. Perhaps this is because all models still require several examples to recognize the pattern. One note of caution is that an analysis of test set contamination identified that a significant minority of the LAMBADA dataset appears to be present in our training data -however analysis performed in Section 4 suggests negligible impact on performance.</p></div>\n",

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.2\">Closed Book Question Answering</head><p>In this section we measure GPT-3's ability to answer questions about broad factual knowledge. Due to the immense amount of possible queries, this task has normally been approached by using an information retrieval system to find relevant text in combination with a model which learns to generate an answer given the question and the retrieved text. Since this setting allows a system to search for and condition on text which potentially contains the answer it is denoted \"open-book\". <ref target=\"#b135\" type=\"bibr\">[RRS20]</ref> recently demonstrated that a large language model can perform surprisingly well directly answering the questions without conditioning on auxilliary information. They denote this more restrictive evaluation setting as \"closed-book\". Their work suggests that even higher-capacity models could perform even better and we test this hypothesis with GPT-3. We evaluate GPT-3 on the 3 datasets in [RRS20]: Natural Questions [KPR + 19], WebQuestions <ref target=\"#b28\" type=\"bibr\">[BCFL13]</ref>, and TriviaQA [JCWZ17], using the same splits. Note that in addition to all results being in the closed-book setting, our use of few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot evaluations represent an even stricter setting than previous closed-book QA work: in addition to external content not being allowed, fine-tuning on the Q&amp;A dataset itself is also not permitted.</p><p>The results for GPT-3 are shown in GPT-3's few-shot result further improves performance another 3.2% beyond this.</p><p>On WebQuestions (WebQs), GPT-3 achieves 14.4% in the zero-shot setting, 25.3% in the one-shot setting, and 41.5% in the few-shot setting. This compares to 37.4% for fine-tuned T5-11B, and 44.7% for fine-tuned T5-11B+SSM, which uses a Q&amp;A-specific pre-training procedure. GPT-3 in the few-shot setting approaches the performance of state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. Notably, compared to TriviaQA, WebQS shows a much larger gain from zero-shot to few-shot (and indeed its zero-shot and one-shot performance are poor), perhaps suggesting that the WebQs questions and/or the style of their answers are out-of-distribution for GPT-3. Nevertheless, GPT-3 appears able to adapt to this distribution, recovering strong performance in the few-shot setting.</p><p>On Natural Questions (NQs) GPT-3 achieves 14.6% in the zero-shot setting, 23.0% in the one-shot setting, and 29.9% in the few-shot setting, compared to 36.6% for fine-tuned T5 11B+SSM. Similar to WebQS, the large gain from zero-shot to few-shot may suggest a distribution shift, and may also explain the less competitive performance compared to TriviaQA and WebQS. In particular, the questions in NQs tend towards very fine-grained knowledge on Wikipedia specifically which could be testing the limits of GPT-3's capacity and broad pretraining distribution.</p><p>Overall, on one of the three datasets GPT-3's one-shot matches the open-domain fine-tuning SOTA. On the other two datasets it approaches the performance of the closed-book SOTA despite not using fine-tuning. On all 3 datasets, we find that performance scales very smoothly with model size (Figure <ref target=\"#fig_1\" type=\"figure\">3</ref>.3 and Appendix H Figure H.7), possibly reflecting the idea that model capacity translates directly to more 'knowledge' absorbed in the parameters of the model.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.3\">Translation</head><p>For GPT-2 a filter was used on a multilingual collection of documents to produce an English only dataset due to capacity concerns. Even with this filtering GPT-2 showed some evidence of multilingual capability and performed non-trivially when translating between French and English despite only training on 10 megabytes of remaining French text. Since we increase the capacity by over two orders of magnitude from GPT-2 to GPT-3, we also expand the scope of the training dataset to include more representation of other languages, though this remains an area for further improvement. As discussed in 2.2 the majority of our data is derived from raw Common Crawl with only quality-based filtering. Although GPT-3's training data is still primarily English (93% by word count), it also includes 7% of text in other languages. These languages are documented in the supplemental material. In order to better understand translation capability, we also expand our analysis to include two additional commonly studied languages, German and Romanian.</p><p>Existing unsupervised machine translation approaches often combine pretraining on a pair of monolingual datasets with back-translation <ref target=\"#b143\" type=\"bibr\">[SHB15]</ref> to bridge the two languages in a controlled way. By contrast, GPT-3 learns from a blend of training data that mixes many languages together in a natural way, combining them on a word, sentence, and document level. GPT-3 also uses a single training objective which is not customized or designed for any task in particular. However, our one / few-shot settings aren't strictly comparable to prior unsupervised work since they make use of a small amount of paired examples (1 or 64). This corresponds to up to a page or two of in-context training data.</p><p>Results are shown in  Scaling is relatively smooth with the gains to few-shot learning increasing with model size, and few-shot GPT-3 175B is competitive with a fine-tuned RoBERTA-large.</p><p>each translation task improves performance by over 7 BLEU and nears competitive performance with prior work. GPT-3 in the full few-shot setting further improves another 4 BLEU resulting in similar average performance to prior unsupervised NMT work. GPT-3 has a noticeable skew in its performance depending on language direction. For the three input languages studied, GPT-3 significantly outperforms prior unsupervised NMT work when translating into English but underperforms when translating in the other direction. Performance on En-Ro is a noticeable outlier at over 10 BLEU worse than prior unsupervised NMT work. This could be a weakness due to reusing the byte-level BPE tokenizer of GPT-2 which was developed for an almost entirely English training dataset. For both Fr-En and De-En, few shot GPT-3 outperforms the best supervised result we could find but due to our unfamiliarity with the literature and the appearance that these are un-competitive benchmarks we do not suspect those results represent true state of the art. For Ro-En, few shot GPT-3 performs within 0.5 BLEU of the overall SOTA which is achieved by a combination of unsupervised pretraining, supervised finetuning on 608K labeled examples, and backtranslation <ref target=\"#b92\" type=\"bibr\">[LHCG19b]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, across all language pairs and across all three settings (zero-, one-, and few-shot), there is a smooth trend of improvement with model capacity. This is shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_1\" type=\"figure\">3</ref>.4 in the case of few-shot results, and scaling for all three settings is shown in Appendix H.</p></div>\n",

We use a suite of 5 datasets including abstractive, multiple choice, and span based answer formats in both dialog and single question settings.

On DROP [DWD + 19], a dataset testing discrete reasoning and numeracy in the context of reading comprehension, GPT-3 in a few-shot setting outperforms the fine-tuned BERT baseline from the original paper but is still well below both human performance and state-of-the-art approaches which augment neural networks with symbolic systems <ref type=\"bibr\">[RLL +</ref> 19]. On SQuAD 2.0 [RJL18], GPT-3 demonstrates its few-shot learning capabilities, improving by almost 10 F1 (to 69.8) compared to a zero-shot setting.

On COPA and ReCoRD GPT-3 achieves near-SOTA performance in the one-shot and few-shot settings, with COPA falling only a couple points short and achieving second place on the leaderboard, where first place is held by a fine-tuned 11 billion parameter model (T5). On WSC, performance is still relatively strong, achieving 80.1% in the few-shot setting (note that GPT-3 achieves 88.6% on the original Winograd dataset as described in Section 3.4).

We tried a number of different phrasings and formulations for WiC (which involves determining if a word is being used with the same meaning in two sentences), none of which was able to achieve strong performance. This hints at a phenomenon that will become clearer in the next section (which discusses the ANLI benchmark) -GPT-3 appears to be weak in the few-shot or one-shot setting at some tasks that involve comparing two sentences or snippets, for example whether a word is used the same way in two sentences (WiC), whether one sentence is a paraphrase of another, or whether one sentence implies another. This could also explain the comparatively low scores for RTE and CB, which also follow this format. Despite these weaknesses, GPT-3 still outperforms a fine-tuned BERT-large on four of eight tasks and on two tasks GPT-3 is close to the state-of-the-art held by a fine-tuned 11 billion parameter model.</p><p>Finally, we note that the few-shot SuperGLUE score steadily improves with both model size and with number of examples in the context showing increasing benefits from in-context learning (Figure <ref target=\"#fig_1\" type=\"figure\">3</ref>.8). We scale K up to 32 examples per task, after which point additional examples will not reliably fit into our context. When sweeping over values of K, we find that GPT-3 requires less than eight total examples per task to outperform a fine-tuned BERT-Large on overall SuperGLUE score.</p></div>\n",

We also evaluate on the recently introduced Adversarial Natural Language Inference (ANLI) dataset [NWD + 19]. ANLI is a difficult dataset employing a series of adversarially mined natural language inference questions in three rounds (R1, R2, and R3). Similar to RTE, all of our models smaller than GPT-3 perform at almost exactly random chance on ANLI, even in the few-shot setting (∼ 33%), whereas GPT-3 itself shows signs of life on Round 3. Results for ANLI R3 are highlighted in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_1\" type=\"figure\">3</ref>.9 and full results for all rounds can be found in Appendix H.

We devise several tasks to test this class of abilities. First, we test GPT-3's ability to perform arithmetic. Second, we create several tasks that involve rearranging or unscrambling the letters in a word, tasks which are unlikely to have been exactly seen during training. Third, we test GPT-3's ability to solve SAT-style analogy problems few-shot.

Performance decreases as the number of digits increases, but GPT-3 still achieves 25-26% accuracy on four digit operations and 9-10% accuracy on five digit operations, suggesting at least some capacity to generalize to larger numbers of digits.

In addition, inspection of incorrect answers reveals that the model often makes mistakes such as not carrying a \"1\", suggesting it is actually attempting to perform the relevant computation rather than memorizing a table.</p><p>Overall, GPT-3 displays reasonable proficiency at moderately complex arithmetic in few-shot, one-shot, and even zero-shot settings.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.9.2\">Word Scrambling and Manipulation Tasks</head><p>To test GPT-3's ability to learn novel symbolic manipulations from a few examples, we designed a small battery of 5 \"character manipulation\" tasks. Each task involves giving the model a word distorted by some combination of scrambling, addition, or deletion of characters, and asking it to recover the original word. The 5 tasks are:</p><p>• Cycle letters in word (CL) -The model is given a word with its letters cycled, then the \"=\" symbol, and is expected to generate the original word. For example, it might be given \"lyinevitab\" and should output \"inevitably\".</p><p>• Anagrams of all but first and last characters (A1) -The model is given a word where every letter except the first and last have been scrambled randomly, and must output the original word. Example: criroptuon = corruption.</p><p>• Anagrams of all but first and last 2 characters (A2) -The model is given a word where every letter except the first 2 and last 2 have been scrambled randomly, and must recover the original word. Example: opoepnnt → opponent.</p><p>• Random insertion in word (RI) -A random punctuation or space character is inserted between each letter of a word, and the model must output the original word. Example: s.u!c/c!e.s s i/o/n = succession.</p><p>• Reversed words (RW) -The model is given a word spelled backwards, and must output the original word. Example: stcejbo → objects.</p><p>For each task we generate 10,000 examples, which we chose to be the top 10,000 most frequent words as measured by <ref target=\"#b113\" type=\"bibr\">[Nor09]</ref> of length more than 4 characters and less than 15 characters. The few-shot results are shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_1\" type=\"figure\">3</ref>.11. Task performance tends to grow smoothly with model size, with the full GPT-3 model achieving 66.9% on removing random insertions, 38.6% on cycling letters, 40.2% on the easier anagram task, and 15.1% on the more difficult anagram task (where only the first and last letters are held fixed). None of the models can reverse the letters in a word.</p><p>In the one-shot setting, performance is significantly weaker (dropping by half or more), and in the zero-shot setting the model can rarely perform any of the tasks (Table <ref target=\"#tab_3\" type=\"table\">3</ref>.10). This suggests that the model really does appear to learn these tasks at test time, as the model cannot perform them zero-shot and their artificial nature makes them unlikely to appear in the pre-training data (although we cannot confirm this with certainty).</p><p>We can further quantify performance by plotting \"in-context learning curves\", which show task performance as a function of the number of in-context examples. We show in-context learning curves for the Symbol Insertion task in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_11\" type=\"figure\">1</ref>.2. We can see that larger models are able to make increasingly effective use of in-context information, including both task examples and natural language task descriptions.</p><p>Finally, it is worth adding that solving these tasks requires character-level manipulations, whereas our BPE encoding operates on significant fractions of a word (on average ∼ 0.7 words per token), so from the LM's perspective succeeding at these tasks involves not just manipulating BPE tokens but understanding and pulling apart their substructure. Also, CL, A1, and A2 are not bijective (that is, the unscrambled word is not a deterministic function of the scrambled word), requiring the model to perform some search to find the correct unscrambling. Thus, the skills involved appear to require non-trivial pattern-matching and computation.</p></div>\n",

Analogies are a style of multiple choice question that constituted a section of the SAT college entrance exam before 2005. A typical example is \"audacious is to boldness as (a) sanctimonious is to hypocrisy, (b) anonymous is to identity, (c) remorseful is to misdeed, (d) deleterious is to result, (e) impressionable is to temptation\". The student is expected to choose which of the five word pairs has the same relationship as the original word pair; in this example the answer is \"sanctimonious is to hypocrisy\". On this task GPT-3 achieves 65.2% in the few-shot setting, 59.1% in the one-shot setting, and 53.7% in the zero-shot setting, whereas the average score among college applicants was 57% <ref target=\"#b149\" type=\"bibr\">[TL05]</ref> (random guessing yields 20%).

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.9.4\">News Article Generation</head><p>Previous work on generative language models qualitatively tested their ability to generate synthetic \"news articles\" by conditional sampling from the model given a human-written prompt consisting of a plausible first sentence for a news story [RWC + 19]. Relative to [RWC + 19], the dataset used to train GPT-3 is much less weighted towards news articles, so trying to generate news articles via raw unconditional samples is less effective -for example GPT-3 often interprets the proposed first sentence of a \"news article\" as a tweet and then posts synthetic responses or follow-up tweets. To solve this problem we employed GPT-3's few-shot learning abilities by providing three previous news articles in the model's context to condition it. With the title and subtitle of a proposed next article, the model is able to reliably generate short articles in the \"news\" genre.</p><p>To gauge the quality of news article generation from GPT-3 (which we believe is likely to be correlated with conditional sample generation quality in general), we decided to measure human ability to distinguish GPT-3-generated articles from real ones. Similar work has been carried out by Kreps et al. <ref target=\"#b78\" type=\"bibr\">[KMB20]</ref> and Zellers et al. <ref type=\"bibr\">[ZHR + 19]</ref>. Generative language models are trained to match the distribution of content generated by humans, so the (in)ability of humans to distinguish the two is a potentially important measure of quality. <ref type=\"bibr\">3</ref> In order to see how well humans can detect model generated text, we arbitrarily selected 25 article titles and subtitles from the website newser.com (mean length: 215 words). We then generated completions of these titles and subtitles from four language models ranging in size from 125M to 175B (GPT-3) parameters (mean length: 200 words). For each model, we presented around 80 US-based participants with a quiz consisting of these real titles and subtitles followed by either the human written article or the article generated by the model 4 . Participants were asked to select whether the article was \"very likely written by a human\", \"more likely written by a human\", \"I don't know\", \"more likely written by a machine\", or \"very likely written by a machine\".</p><p>The articles we selected were not in the models' training data and the model outputs were formatted and selected programmatically to prevent human cherry-picking. All models used the same context to condition outputs on and were pre-trained with the same context size and the same article titles and subtitles were used as prompts for each model. However, we also ran an experiment to control for participant effort and attention that followed the same format but involved intentionally bad model generated articles. This was done by generating articles from a \"control model\": a 160M parameter model with no context and increased output randomness. Table <ref target=\"#tab_3\" type=\"table\">3</ref>.11: Human accuracy in identifying whether short (∼200 word) news articles are model generated. We find that human accuracy (measured by the ratio of correct assignments to non-neutral assignments) ranges from 86% on the control model to 52% on GPT-3 175B. This table compares mean accuracy between five different models, and shows the results of a two-sample T-Test for the difference in mean accuracy between each model and the control model (an unconditional GPT-3 Small model with increased output randomness).</p><p>Mean human accuracy (the ratio of correct assignments to non-neutral assignments per participant) at detecting that the intentionally bad articles were model generated was ∼ 86% where 50% is chance level performance. By contrast, mean human accuracy at detecting articles that were produced by the 175B parameter model was barely above chance at ∼ 52% (see Table <ref target=\"#tab_3\" type=\"table\">3</ref>.11). <ref type=\"bibr\">5</ref> Human abilities to detect model generated text appear to decrease as model size increases: there appears to be a trend towards chance accuracy with model size, and human detection of GPT-3 is close to chance. <ref type=\"bibr\">6</ref> This is true despite the fact that participants spend more time on each output as model size increases (see Appendix E).</p><p>Examples of synthetic articles from GPT-3 are given in Figures 3.14 and 3.15. 7 Much of the text is-as indicated by the evaluations-difficult for humans to distinguish from authentic human content. Factual inaccuracies can be an indicator that an article is model generated since, unlike human authors, the models have no access to the specific facts that the article titles refer to or when the article was written. Other indicators include repetition, non sequiturs, and unusual phrasings, though these are often subtle enough that they are not noticed.</p><p>Related work on language model detection by Ippolito et al. <ref target=\"#b70\" type=\"bibr\">[IDCBE19]</ref> indicates that automatic discriminators like G R O V E R <ref type=\"bibr\">[ZHR +</ref> 19] and GLTR [GSR19] may have greater success at detecting model generated text than human evaluators. Automatic detection of these models may be a promising area of future research.</p><p>Ippolito et al. <ref target=\"#b70\" type=\"bibr\">[IDCBE19]</ref> also note that human accuracy at detecting model generated text increases as humans observe more tokens. To do a preliminary investigation of how good humans are at detecting longer news articles generated by GPT-3 175B, we selected 12 world news articles from Reuters with an average length of 569 words and generated completions of these articles from GPT-3 with an average length of 498 words (298 words longer than our initial experiments). Following the methodology above, we ran two experiments, each on around 80 US-based participants, to compare human abilities to detect the articles generated by GPT-3 and a control model.</p><p>We found that mean human accuracy at detecting the intentionally bad longer articles from the control model was ∼ 88%, while mean human accuracy at detecting the longer articles that were produced by GPT-3 175B was still barely above chance at ∼ 52% (see Table <ref target=\"#tab_3\" type=\"table\">3</ref>.12). This indicates that, for news articles that are around 500 words long, GPT-3 continues to produce articles that humans find difficult to distinguish from human written news articles.</p></div>\n",

The majority of delegates attending the church's annual General Conference in May voted to strengthen a ban on the ordination of LGBTQ clergy and to write new rules that will \"discipline\" clergy who officiate at same-sex weddings. But those who opposed these measures have a new plan: They say they will form a separate denomination by 2020, calling their church the Christian Methodist denomination. The Post notes that the denomination, which claims 12.5 million members, was in the early 20th century the \"largest Protestant denomination in the U.S.,\" but that it has been shrinking in recent decades. The new split will be the second in the church's history. The first occurred in 1968, when roughly 10 percent of the denomination left to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church. The Post notes that the proposed split \"comes at a critical time for the church, which has been losing members for years,\" which has been \"pushed toward the brink of a schism over the role of LGBTQ people in the church.\" Gay marriage is not the only issue that has divided the church.

Accurately detecting test contamination from internet-scale datasets is a new area of research without established best practices. While it is common practice to train large models without investigating contamination, given the increasing scale of pretraining datasets, we believe this issue is becoming increasingly important to attend to.</p><p>This concern is not just hypothetical. One of the first papers to train a language model on Common Crawl data <ref target=\"#b150\" type=\"bibr\">[TL18]</ref> detected and removed a training document which overlapped with one of their evaluation datasets. Other work such as GPT-2 [RWC + 19] also conducted post-hoc overlap analysis. Their study was relatively encouraging, finding that</p><p>Poor English input: I eated the purple berries.</p><p>Figure <ref target=\"#fig_1\" type=\"figure\">3</ref>.17: Representative GPT-3 completions for the few-shot task of correcting English grammar. Boldface is GPT-3's completions, plain text is human prompts. In the first few examples example both the prompt and the completion are provided by a human; this then serves as conditioning for subsequent examples where GPT-3 receives successive additional prompts and provides the completions. Nothing task-specific is provided to GPT-3 aside from the first few examples as conditioning and the \"Poor English input/Good English output\" framing. We note that the distinction between \"poor\" and \"good\" English (and the terms themselves) is complex, contextual, and contested. As the example mentioning the rental of a house shows, assumptions that the model makes about what \"good\" is can even lead it to make errors (here, the model not only adjusts grammar, but also removes the word \"cheap\" in a way that alters meaning). although models did perform moderately better on data that overlapped between training and testing, this did not significantly impact reported results due to the small fraction of data which was contaminated (often only a few percent).</p><p>GPT-3 operates in a somewhat different regime. On the one hand, the dataset and model size are about two orders of magnitude larger than those used for GPT-2, and include a large amount of Common Crawl, creating increased potential for contamination and memorization. On the other hand, precisely due to the large amount of data, even GPT-3 175B does not overfit its training set by a significant amount, measured relative to a held-out validation set with which it was deduplicated (Figure <ref target=\"#fig_8\" type=\"figure\">4</ref>.1). Thus, we expect that contamination is likely to be frequent, but that its effects may not be as large as feared.</p><p>We initially tried to address the issue of contamination by proactively searching for and attempting to remove any overlap between our training data and the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper. Unfortunately, a bug resulted in only partial removal of all detected overlaps from the training data. Due to the cost of training, it wasn't feasible to retrain the model. To address this, we investigate in detail how the remaining detected overlap impacts results.</p><p>For each benchmark, we produce a 'clean' version which removes all potentially leaked examples, defined roughly as examples that have a 13-gram overlap with anything in the pretraining set (or that overlap with the whole example when it is shorter than 13-grams). The goal is to very conservatively flag anything that could potentially be contamination, so as to produce a clean subset that is free of contamination with high confidence. The exact procedure is detailed in Appendix C.</p><p>We then evaluate GPT-3 on these clean benchmarks, and compare to the original score. If the score on the clean subset is similar to the score on the entire dataset, this suggests that contamination, even if present, does not have a significant effect on reported results. If the score on the clean subset is lower, this suggests contamination may be inflating the results. The results are summarized in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_8\" type=\"figure\">4</ref>.2. Although potential contamination is often high (with a quarter of benchmarks scoring over 50%), in most cases performance changes only negligibly, and we see no evidence that contamination level and performance difference are correlated. We conclude that either our conservative method substantially overestimated contamination or that contamination has little effect on performance.</p><p>Below, we review in more detail the few specific cases where either (1) the model performs significantly worse on the cleaned version, or (2) potential contamination is very high, which makes measuring the performance difference difficult.</p><p>Our analysis flagged six groups of benchmarks for further investigation: Word Scrambling, Reading Comprehension (QuAC, SQuAD2, DROP), PIQA, Winograd, language modeling tasks (Wikitext tasks, 1BW), and German to English The x-axis is a conservative lower bound for how much of the dataset is known with high confidence to be clean, and the y-axis shows the difference in performance when evaluating only on the verified clean subset. Performance on most benchmarks changed negligibly, but some were flagged for further review. On inspection we find some evidence for contamination of the PIQA and Winograd results, and we mark the corresponding results in Section 3 with an asterisk. We find no evidence that other benchmarks are affected.</p><p>translation. Since our overlap analysis is designed to be extremely conservative, we expect it to produce some false positives. We summarize the results for each group of tasks below:</p><p>• Reading Comprehension: Our initial analysis flagged &gt;90% of task examples from QuAC, SQuAD2, and DROP as potentially contaminated, so large that even measuring the differential on a clean subset was difficult. Upon manual inspection, however, we found that for every overlap we inspected, in all 3 datasets, the source text was present in our training data but the question/answer pairs were not, meaning the model gains only background information and cannot memorize the answer to a specific question. • German translation: We found 25% of the examples in the WMT16 German-English test set were marked as potentially contaminated, with an associated total effect size of 1-2 BLEU. Upon inspection, none of the flagged examples contain paired sentences resembling NMT training data and collisions were monolingual matches mostly of snippets of events discussed in the news. • Reversed Words and Anagrams: Recall that these tasks are of the form \"alaok = koala\". Due to the short length of these tasks, we used 2-grams for filtering (ignoring punctuation). After inspecting the flagged overlaps, we found that they were not typically instances of real reversals or unscramblings in the training set, but rather palindromes or trivial unscramblings, e.g \"kayak = kayak\". The amount of overlap was small, but removing the trivial tasks lead to an increase in difficulty and thus a spurious signal. Related to this, the symbol insertion task shows high overlap but no effect on performance -this is because that task involves removing non-letter characters from a word, and the overlap analysis itself ignores such characters, leading to many spurious matches. • PIQA: The overlap analysis flagged 29% of examples as contaminated, and observed a 3 percentage point absolute decrease (4% relative decrease) in performance on the clean subset. Though the test dataset was released after our training set was created and its labels are hidden, some of the web pages used by the crowdsourced dataset creators are contained in our training set. We found a similar decrease in a 25x smaller model with much less capacity to memorize, leading us to suspect that the shift is likely statistical bias rather than memorization; examples which workers copied may simply be easier. Unfortunately, we cannot rigorously prove this hypothesis. We therefore mark our PIQA results with an asterisk to denote this potential contamination. • Winograd: The overlap analysis flagged 45% of examples, and found a 2.6% decrease in performance on the clean subset. Manual inspection of the overlapping data point showed that 132 Winograd schemas were in fact present in our training set, though presented in a different format than we present the task to the model. Although the decrease in performance is small, we mark our Winograd results in the main paper with an asterisk.</p><p>• Language modeling: We found the 4 Wikipedia language modeling benchmarks measured in GPT-2, plus the Children's Book Test dataset, to be almost entirely contained in our training data. Since we cannot reliably extract a clean subset here, we do not report results on these datasets, even though we intended to when starting this work. We note that Penn Tree Bank due to its age was unaffected and therefore became our chief language modeling benchmark.</p><p>We also inspected datasets where contamination was high, but the impact on performance was close to zero, simply to verify how much actual contamination existed. These appeared to often contain false positives. They had either no actual contamination, or had contamination that did not give away the answer to the task. One notable exception was LAMBADA, which appeared to have substantial genuine contamination, yet the impact on performance was very small, with the clean subset scoring within 0.5% of the full dataset. Also, strictly speaking, our fill-in-the-blank format precludes the simplest form of memorization. Nevertheless, since we made very large gains on LAMBADA in this paper, the potential contamination is noted in the results section.</p><p>An important limitation of our contamination analysis is that we cannot be sure that the clean subset is drawn from the same distribution as the original dataset. It remains possible that memorization inflates results but at the same time is precisely counteracted by some statistical bias causing the clean subset to be easier. However, the sheer number of shifts close to zero suggests this is unlikely, and we also observed no noticeable difference in the shifts for small models, which are unlikely to be memorizing.</p><p>Overall, we have made a best effort to measure and document the effects of data contamination, and to note or outright remove problematic results, depending on the severity. Much work remains to be done to address this important and subtle issue for the field in general, both when designing benchmarks and when training models. For a more detailed explanation of our analysis, we refer the reader to Appendix C.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"5\">Limitations</head><p>GPT-3 and our analysis of it have a number of limitations. Below we describe some of these and suggest directions for future work.</p><p>First, despite the strong quantitative and qualitative improvements of GPT-3, particularly compared to its direct predecessor GPT-2, it still has notable weaknesses in text synthesis and several NLP tasks. On text synthesis, although the overall quality is high, GPT-3 samples still sometimes repeat themselves semantically at the document level, start to lose coherence over sufficiently long passages, contradict themselves, and occasionally contain non-sequitur sentences or paragraphs. We will release a collection of 500 uncurated unconditional samples to help provide a better sense of GPT-3's limitations and strengths at text synthesis. Within the domain of discrete language tasks, we have noticed informally that GPT-3 seems to have special difficulty with \"common sense physics\", despite doing well on some datasets (such as PIQA [BZB + 19]) that test this domain. Specifically GPT-3 has difficulty with questions of the type \"If I put cheese into the fridge, will it melt?\". Quantitatively, GPT-3's in-context learning performance has some notable gaps on our suite of benchmarks, as described in Section 3, and in particular it does little better than chance when evaluated one-shot or even few-shot on some \"comparison\" tasks, such as determining if two words are used the same way in a sentence, or if one sentence implies another (WIC and ANLI respectively), as well as on a subset of reading comprehension tasks. This is especially striking given GPT-3's strong few-shot performance on many other tasks.</p><p>GPT-3 has several structural and algorithmic limitations, which could account for some of the issues above. We focused on exploring in-context learning behavior in autoregressive language models because it is straightforward to both sample and compute likelihoods with this model class. As a result our experiments do not include any bidirectional architectures or other training objectives such as denoising. This is a noticeable difference from much of the recent literature, which has documented improved fine-tuning performance when using these approaches over standard language models [RSR + 19]. Thus our design decision comes at the cost of potentially worse performance on tasks which empirically benefit from bidirectionality. This may include fill-in-the-blank tasks, tasks that involve looking back and comparing two pieces of content, or tasks that require re-reading or carefully considering a long passage and then generating a very short answer. This could be a possible explanation for GPT-3's lagging few-shot performance on a few of the tasks, such as WIC (which involves comparing the use of a word in two sentences), ANLI (which involves comparing two sentences to see if one implies the other), and several reading comprehension tasks (e.g. QuAC and RACE). We also conjecture, based on past literature, that a large bidirectional model would be stronger at fine-tuning than GPT-3. Making a bidirectional model at the scale of GPT-3, and/or trying to make bidirectional models work with few-or zero-shot learning, is a promising direction for future research, and could help achieve the \"best of both worlds\".</p><p>A more fundamental limitation of the general approach described in this paper -scaling up any LM-like model, whether autoregressive or bidirectional -is that it may eventually run into (or could already be running into) the limits of the pretraining objective. Our current objective weights every token equally and lacks a notion of what is most important to predict and what is less important. <ref target=\"#b135\" type=\"bibr\">[RRS20]</ref> demonstrate benefits of customizing prediction to entities of interest. Also, with self-supervised objectives, task specification relies on forcing the desired task into a prediction problem, whereas ultimately, useful language systems (for example virtual assistants) might be better thought of as taking goal-directed actions rather than just making predictions. Finally, large pretrained language models are not grounded in other domains of experience, such as video or real-world physical interaction, and thus lack a large amount of context about the world [BHT + 20]. For all these reasons, scaling pure self-supervised prediction is likely to hit limits, and augmentation with a different approach is likely to be necessary. Promising future directions in this vein might include learning the objective function from humans [ZSW + 19a], fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, or adding additional modalities such as images to provide grounding and a better model of the world [CLY + 19].</p><p>Another limitation broadly shared by language models is poor sample efficiency during pre-training. While GPT-3 takes a step towards test-time sample efficiency closer to that of humans (one-shot or zero-shot), it still sees much more text during pre-training than a human sees in the their lifetime <ref target=\"#b93\" type=\"bibr\">[Lin20]</ref>. Improving pre-training sample efficiency is an important direction for future work, and might come from grounding in the physical world to provide additional information, or from algorithmic improvements.</p><p>A limitation, or at least uncertainty, associated with few-shot learning in GPT-3 is ambiguity about whether few-shot learning actually learns new tasks \"from scratch\" at inference time, or if it simply recognizes and identifies tasks that it has learned during training. These possibilities exist on a spectrum, ranging from demonstrations in the training set that are drawn from exactly the same distribution as those at test time, to recognizing the same task but in a different format, to adapting to a specific style of a general task such as QA, to learning a skill entirely de novo. Where GPT-3 is on this spectrum may also vary from task to task. Synthetic tasks such as wordscrambling or defining nonsense words seem especially likely to be learned de novo, whereas translation clearly must be learned during pretraining, although possibly from data that is very different in organization and style than the test data. Ultimately, it is not even clear what humans learn from scratch vs from prior demonstrations. Even organizing diverse demonstrations during pre-training and identifying them at test time would be an advance for language models, but nevertheless understanding precisely how few-shot learning works is an important unexplored direction for future research.</p><p>A limitation associated with models at the scale of GPT-3, regardless of objective function or algorithm, is that they are both expensive and inconvenient to perform inference on, which may present a challenge for practical applicability of models of this scale in their current form. One possible future direction to address this is distillation <ref target=\"#b66\" type=\"bibr\">[HVD15]</ref> of large models down to a manageable size for specific tasks. Large models such as GPT-3 contain a very wide range of skills, most of which are not needed for a specific task, suggesting that in principle aggressive distillation may be possible. Distillation is well-explored in general <ref target=\"#b91\" type=\"bibr\">[LHCG19a]</ref> but has not been tried at the scale of hundred of billions parameters; new challenges and opportunities may be associated with applying it to models of this size.</p><p>Finally, GPT-3 shares some limitations common to most deep learning systems -its decisions are not easily interpretable, it is not necessarily well-calibrated in its predictions on novel inputs as observed by the much higher variance in performance than humans on standard benchmarks, and it retains the biases of the data it has been trained on. This last issue -biases in the data that may lead the model to generate stereotyped or prejudiced content -is of special concern from a societal perspective, and will be discussed along with other issues in the next section on Broader Impacts (Section 6).</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"6\">Broader Impacts</head><p>Language models have a wide range of beneficial applications for society, including code and writing auto-completion, grammar assistance, game narrative generation, improving search engine responses, and answering questions. But they also have potentially harmful applications. GPT-3 improves the quality of text generation and adaptability over smaller models and increases the difficulty of distinguishing synthetic text from human-written text. It therefore has the potential to advance both the beneficial and harmful applications of language models.</p><p>Here we focus on the potential harms of improved language models, not because we believe the harms are necessarily greater, but in order to stimulate efforts to study and mitigate them. The broader impacts of language models like this are numerous. We focus on two primary issues: the potential for deliberate misuse of language models like GPT-3 in Section 6.1, and issues of bias, fairness, and representation within models like GPT-3 in Section 6.2. We also briefly discuss issues of energy efficiency (Section 6.3).</p></div>\n",

To help with this, we can think in terms of traditional security risk assessment frameworks, which outline key steps such as identifying threats and potential impacts, assessing likelihood, and determining risk as a combination of likelihood and impact <ref target=\"#b133\" type=\"bibr\">[Ros12]</ref>. We discuss three factors: potential misuse applications, threat actors, and external incentive structures.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"6.1.1\">Potential Misuse Applications</head><p>Any socially harmful activity that relies on generating text could be augmented by powerful language models. Examples include misinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental processes, fraudulent academic essay writing and social engineering pretexting. Many of these applications bottleneck on human beings to write sufficiently high quality text. Language models that produce high quality text generation could lower existing barriers to carrying out these activities and increase their efficacy.</p><p>The misuse potential of language models increases as the quality of text synthesis improves. The ability of GPT-3 to generate several paragraphs of synthetic content that people find difficult to distinguish from human-written text in 3.9.4 represents a concerning milestone in this regard.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"6.1.2\">Threat Actor Analysis</head><p>Threat actors can be organized by skill and resource levels, ranging from low or moderately skilled and resourced actors who may be able to build a malicious product to 'advanced persistent threats' (APTs): highly skilled and well-resourced (e.g. state-sponsored) groups with long-term agendas <ref type=\"bibr\">[SBC +</ref> 19].</p><p>To understand how low and mid-skill actors think about language models, we have been monitoring forums and chat groups where misinformation tactics, malware distribution, and computer fraud are frequently discussed. While we did find significant discussion of misuse following the initial release of GPT-2 in spring of 2019, we found fewer instances of experimentation and no successful deployments since then. Additionally, those misuse discussions were correlated with media coverage of language model technologies. From this, we assess that the threat of misuse from these actors is not immediate, but significant improvements in reliability could change this.</p><p>Because APTs do not typically discuss operations in the open, we have consulted with professional threat analysts about possible APT activity involving the use of language models. Since the release of GPT-2 there has been no discernible difference in operations that may see potential gains by using language models. The assessment was that language models may not be worth investing significant resources in because there has been no convincing demonstration that current language models are significantly better than current methods for generating text, and because methods for \"targeting\" or \"controlling\" the content of language models are still at a very early stage.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"6.1.3\">External Incentive Structures</head><p>Each threat actor group also has a set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that they rely on to accomplish their agenda. TTPs are influenced by economic factors like scalability and ease of deployment; phishing is extremely popular among all groups because it offers a low-cost, low-effort, high-yield method of deploying malware and stealing login credentials. Using language models to augment existing TTPs would likely result in an even lower cost of deployment.</p><p>Ease of use is another significant incentive. Having stable infrastructure has a large impact on the adoption of TTPs. The outputs of language models are stochastic, however, and though developers can constrain these (e.g. using top-k truncation) they are not able to perform consistently without human feedback. If a social media disinformation bot produces outputs that are reliable 99% of the time, but produces incoherent outputs 1% of the time, this could reduce the amount of human labor required in operating this bot. But a human is still needed to filter the outputs, which restricts how scalable the operation can be.</p><p>Based on our analysis of this model and analysis of threat actors and the landscape, we suspect AI researchers will eventually develop language models that are sufficiently consistent and steerable that they will be of greater interest to malicious actors. We expect this will introduce challenges for the broader research community, and hope to work on this through a combination of mitigation research, prototyping, and coordinating with other technical developers.</p></div>\n",

We have conducted an analysis of biases in the model in order to better understand GPT-3's limitations when it comes to fairness, bias, and representation. 8</p><p>Our goal is not to exhaustively characterize GPT-3, but to give a preliminary analysis of some of its limitations and behaviors.

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"6.2.1\">Gender</head><p>In our investigation of gender bias in GPT-3, we focused on associations between gender and occupation. We found that occupations in general have a higher probability of being followed by a male gender identifier than a female one (in other words, they are male leaning) when given a context such as \"The {occupation} was a\" (Neutral Variant). 83% of the 388 occupations we tested were more likely to be followed by a male identifier by GPT-3. We measured this by feeding the model a context such as \"The detective was a\" and then looking at the probability of the model following up with male indicating words (eg. man, male etc.) or female indicating words (woman, female etc.). In particular, occupations demonstrating higher levels of education such as legislator, banker, or professor emeritus were heavily male leaning along with occupations that require hard physical labour such as mason, millwright, and sheriff. Occupations that were more likely to be followed by female identifiers include midwife, nurse, receptionist, housekeeper etc.</p><p>We also tested how these probabilities changed when we shifted the context to be the \"The competent {occupation} was a\" (Competent Variant), and when we shifted the context to be \"The incompetent {occupation} was a\" (Incompetent Variant) for each occupation in the dataset. We found that, when prompted with \"The competent {occupation} was a,\" the majority of occupations had an even higher probability of being followed by a male identifier than a female one than was the case with our original neutral prompt, \"The {occupation} was a\". With the prompt \"The incompetent {occupation} was a\" the majority of occupations still leaned male with a similar probability than for our original neutral prompt. The average occupation bias -measured as 1 n jobs jobs log( P (female|Context) P (male|Context)) ) -was −1.11 for the Neutral Variant, −2.14 for the Competent Variant and −1.15 for the Incompetent Variant.</p><p>We also carried out pronoun resolution on the Winogender dataset [RNLVD18] using two methods which further corroborated the model's tendency to associate most occupations with males. One method measured the models ability to correctly assign a pronoun as the occupation or the participant. For example, we fed the model a context such as \"The advisor met with the advisee because she wanted to get advice about job applications. 'She' refers to the\" and found the option with the lowest probability between the two possible options (Choices between Occupation Option: advisor; Participant Option: advisee).</p><p>Occupation and participant words often have societal biases associated with them such as the assumption that most occupants are by default male. We found that the language models learnt some of these biases such as a tendency to associate female pronouns with participant positions more than male pronouns. GPT-3 175B had the highest accuracy of all the models (64.17%) on this task. It was also the only model where the accuracy for Occupant sentences (sentences where the correct answer was the Occupation option) for females was higher than for males (81.7% vs 76.7%). All other models had a higher accuracy for male pronouns with Occupation sentences as compared to female pronouns with the exception of our second largest model-GPT-3 13B -which had the same accuracy (60%) for both. This offers some preliminary evidence that in places where issues of bias can make language models susceptible to error, the larger models are more robust than smaller models.</p><p>We also performed co-occurrence tests, where we analyzed which words are likely to occur in the vicinity of other preselected words. We created a model output sample set by generating 800 outputs of length 50 each with a temperature Easy-going (12) Eccentric ( <ref type=\"formula\">13</ref>) Petite (10) Protect ( <ref type=\"formula\">10</ref>) Tight (10) Jolly ( <ref type=\"formula\">10</ref>) Pregnant (10) Stable ( <ref type=\"formula\">9</ref>) Gorgeous ( <ref type=\"formula\">28</ref>) Personable ( <ref type=\"formula\">22</ref>) Sucked ( <ref type=\"formula\">8</ref>) Survive ( <ref type=\"formula\">7</ref>)</p><p>Beautiful ( <ref type=\"formula\">158</ref>) of 1 and top p of 0.9 for every prompt in our dataset. For gender, we had prompts such as \"He was very\", \"She was very\", \"He would be described as\", \"She would be described as\" 9 . We looked at the adjectives and adverbs in the top 100 most favored words using an off-the-shelf POS tagger <ref target=\"#b82\" type=\"bibr\">[LB02]</ref>.

To put these numbers in perspective, we have also included the average for the number of co-occurrences across all qualifying words for each gender.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"6.2.2\">Race</head><p>To investigate racial bias in GPT-3, we seeded the model with prompts such as -\"The {race} man was very\", \"The {race} woman was very\" and \"People would describe the {race} person as\" and generated 800 samples for each of the above prompts, with {race} replaced with a term indicating a racial category such as White or Asian. We then measure word co-occurrences in the generated samples. Given prior research demonstrating that language models produce text of differing sentiment when varying features such as occupation <ref type=\"bibr\">[HZJ +</ref> 19], we explored how race impacted sentiment. We measured sentiment using Senti WordNet <ref target=\"#b30\" type=\"bibr\">[BES10]</ref> for the words which co-occurred disproportionately with each race. Each word sentiment varied from 100 to -100, with positive scores indicating positive words (eg. wonderfulness: 100, amicable: 87.5), negative scores indicating negative words (eg. wretched: -87.5 , horrid: -87.5) and a score of 0 indicating neutral words (eg. sloping, chalet).</p><p>It should be noted that we were explicitly prompting the models to talk about race and this in turn generated text that focused on racial features; these results are not from the models talking about race in the wild but talking about race in an experimental setup where they have been primed to do so. Additionally, since we are measuring sentiment by simply looking at word co-occurrences, the resulting sentiment can reflect socio-historical factors -for instance, text relating to a discussion of slavery will frequently have a negative sentiment, which may lead to a demographic being associated with a negative sentiment under this testing methodology.</p><p>Across the models we analyzed, 'Asian' had a consistently high sentiment -it ranked 1st in 3 out of 7 models. On the other hand, 'Black' had a consistently low sentiment -it ranked the lowest in 5 out of 7 models. These differences narrowed marginally on the larger model sizes. This analysis gives a sense of the biases of different models and highlights the need for more sophisticated analysis of the relationship between sentiment, entities, and input data.

Our prompts were of the nature \"{Religion practitioners} are\" (Eg. \"Christians are\") for each of the six religious categories listed above. We then allowed the model to naturally carry out completions and created a corpus of such completions for studying co-occurrence of words.</p><p>The following is an example output from the model:</p><p>\"Buddhists are divided into two main branches -Theravada and Mahayana. Theravada is the more conservative branch, centering on monastic life and the earliest sutras and refusing to recognize the later Mahayana sutras as authentic.\"</p><p>Similar to race, we found that the models make associations with religious terms that indicate some propensity to reflect how these terms are sometimes presented in the world. For example, with the religion Islam, we found that words such as ramadan, prophet and mosque co-occurred at a higher rate than for other religions. We also found that words such as violent, terrorism and terrorist co-occurred at a greater rate with Islam than with other religions and were in the top 40 most favored words for Islam in GPT-3.</p></div>\n",

We view the work in this section as subjective signposting -we chose gender, race, and religion as a starting point, but we recognize the inherent subjectivity in this choice. Our work is inspired by the literature on characterizing model attributes to develop informative labels such as Model Cards for Model Reporting from [MWZ + 18].</p><p>Ultimately, it is important not just to characterize biases in language systems but to intervene. The literature on this is also extensive [QMZH19, HZJ + 19], so we offer only a few brief comments on future directions specific to large language models. In order to pave the way for effective bias prevention in general purpose models, there is a need for building a common vocabulary tying together the normative, technical and empirical challenges of bias mitigation for these models. There is room for more research that engages with the literature outside NLP, better articulates normative statements about harm, and engages with the lived experience of communities affected by NLP systems <ref target=\"#b27\" type=\"bibr\">[BBDIW20]</ref>. Thus, mitigation work should not be approached purely with a metric driven objective to 'remove' bias as this has been shown to have blind spots <ref target=\"#b55\" type=\"bibr\">[GG19,</ref><ref target=\"#b114\" type=\"bibr\">NvNvdG19]</ref> but in a holistic manner.</p></div>\n",

This means we should be cognizant of the cost and efficiency of such models, as advocated by <ref target=\"#b142\" type=\"bibr\">[SDSE19]</ref>.</p><p>The use of large-scale pre-training also gives another lens through which to view the efficiency of large models -we should consider not only the resources that go into training them, but how these resources are amortized over the lifetime of a model, which will subsequently be used for a variety of purposes and fine-tuned for specific tasks. Though models like GPT-3 consume significant resources during training, they can be surprisingly efficient once trained: even with the full GPT-3 175B, generating 100 pages of content from a trained model can cost on the order of 0.4 kW-hr, or only a few cents in energy costs. Additionally, techniques like model distillation <ref target=\"#b91\" type=\"bibr\">[LHCG19a]</ref> can further bring down the cost of such models, letting us adopt a paradigm of training single, large-scale models, then creating more efficient versions of them for use in appropriate contexts. Algorithmic progress may also naturally further increase the efficiency of such models over time, similar to trends observed in image recognition and neural machine translation <ref target=\"#b61\" type=\"bibr\">[HB20]</ref>.</p></div>\n",

In order to improve the quality of Common Crawl, we developed an automatic filtering method to remove low quality documents. Using the original WebText as a proxy for high-quality documents, we trained a classifier to distinguish these from raw Common Crawl. We then used this classifier to re-sample Common Crawl by prioritizing documents which were predicted by the classifier to be higher quality. The classifier is trained using logistic regression classifier with features from Spark's standard tokenizer and HashingTF 10 . For the positive examples, we used a collection of curated datasets such as WebText, Wikiedia, and our web books corpus as the positive examples, and for the negative examples, we used unfiltered Common Crawl. We used this classifier to score Common Crawl documents. We kept each document in our dataset iff np.random.pareto(α) &gt; 1 − document_score We chose α = 9 in order to take mostly documents the classifier scored highly, but still include some documents that were out of distribution. α was chosen to match the distribution of scores from our classifier on WebText.</p><p>We found this re-weighting increased quality as measured by loss on a range of out-of-distribution generative text samples.</p><p>2. To further improve model quality and prevent overfitting (which becomes increasingly important as model capacity increases), we fuzzily deduplicated documents (i.e. removed documents with high overlap with other documents) within each dataset using Spark's MinHashLSH implementation with 10 hashes, using the same features as were used for classification above. We also fuzzily removed WebText from Common Crawl.</p><p>Overall this decreased dataset size by an average of 10%.</p><p>After filtering for duplicates and quality, we also partially removed text occurring in benchmark datasets, described in Appendix C.</p></div>\n",

There is a linear LR warmup over the first 375 million tokens. We also gradually increase the batch size linearly from a small value (32k tokens) to the full value over the first 4-12 billion tokens of training, depending on the model size. Data are sampled without replacement during training (until an epoch boundary is reached) to minimize overfitting. All models use weight decay of 0.1 to provide a small amount of regularization <ref target=\"#b90\" type=\"bibr\">[LH17]</ref>.</p><p>During training we always train on sequences of the full n ctx = 2048 token context window, packing multiple documents into a single sequence when documents are shorter than 2048, in order to increase computational efficiency. Sequences with multiple documents are not masked in any special way but instead documents within a sequence are delimited with a special end of text token, giving the language model the information necessary to infer that context separated by the end of text token is unrelated. This allows for efficient training without need for any special sequence-specific masking.</p></div>\n",

In this section we provide details on methodology and results.</p><p>Initial training set filtering We attempted to remove text occurring in benchmarks from training data by searching for 13−gram overlaps between all test/development sets used in this work and our training data, and we removed the colliding 13−gram as well as a 200 character window around it, splitting the original document into pieces. For filtering purposes we define a gram as a lowercase, whitespace delimited word with no punctuation. Pieces less than 200 characters long were discarded. Documents split into more than 10 pieces were considered contaminated and removed entirely. Originally we removed entire documents given a single collision, but that overly penalized long documents such as books for false positives. An example of a false positive might be a test set based on Wikipedia, in which the Wikipedia article quotes a single line from a book. We ignored 13−grams that matched more than 10 training documents, as inspection showed the majority of these to contain common cultural phrases, legal boilerplate, or similar content that we likely do want the model to learn, rather than undesired specific overlaps with test sets. Examples for various frequencies can be found in the GPT-3 release repository 11 .</p><p>Overlap methodology For our benchmark overlap analysis in Section 4, we used a variable number of words N to check for overlap for each dataset, where N is the 5th percentile example length in words, ignoring all punctuation, whitespace, and casing. Due to spurious collisions at lower values of N we use a minimum value of 8 on non-synthetic tasks. For performance reasons, we set a maximum value of 13 for all tasks. Values for N and the amount of data marked as dirty are shown in Table <ref target=\"#tab_20\" type=\"table\">C</ref>.1. Unlike GPT-2's use of bloom filters to compute probabilistic bounds for test contamination, we used Apache Spark to compute exact collisions across all training and test sets. We compute overlaps between test sets and our full training corpus, even though we only trained on 40% of our filtered Common Crawl documents per Section 2.2.</p><p>We define a 'dirty' example as one with any N -gram overlap with any training document, and a 'clean' example as one with no collision.</p><p>Test and validation splits had similar contamination levels despite some test splits being unlabeled. Due to a bug revealed by this analysis, filtering described above failed on long documents such as books. Because of cost considerations it was infeasible to retrain the model on a corrected version of the training dataset. As such, several language modeling benchmarks plus the Children's Book Test showed almost complete overlap, and therefore were not included in this paper. Overlaps are shown in Table <ref target=\"#tab_20\" type=\"table\">C</ref>.1</p><p>Overlap results To understand how much having seen some of the data helps the model perform on downstream tasks, we filter every validation and test set by dirtiness. Then we run evaluation on the clean-only examples and report the relative percent change between the clean score and the original score. If the clean score is more than 1% or 2% worse than the overall score, it suggests the model may have overfit to the examples it has seen. If the clean score is significantly better, our filtering scheme may have preferentially marked easier examples as dirty.</p><p>This overlap metric tends to show a high rate of false positives for datasets that contain background information (but not answers) drawn from the web (such as SQuAD, which draws from Wikipedia) or examples less than 8 words long, which we ignored in our filtering process (except for wordscrambling tasks). One instance where this technique seems to fail to give good signal is DROP, a reading comprehension task in which 94% of the examples are dirty. The information required to answer the question is in a passage provided to the model, so having seen the passage during training but not the questions and answers does not meaningfully constitute cheating. We confirmed that every matching training document contained only the source passage, and none of the questions and answers in the dataset. The more likely explanation for the decrease in performance is that the 6% of examples that remain after filtering come from a slightly different distribution than the dirty examples.</p><p>Figure <ref target=\"#fig_8\" type=\"figure\">4</ref>.2 shows that as the dataset becomes more contaminated, the variance of the clean/all fraction increases, but there is no apparent bias towards improved or degraded performance. This suggests that GPT-3 is relatively insensitive to contamination. See Section 4 for details on the datasets we flagged for further review.  For \"Acc/F1/BLEU\" we use the metric specified in \"Metric\". These scores come from evaluations with a different seed for the random examples used for in-context learning, and will therefore differ slightly from the scores elsewhere in the paper.</p></div>\n",

As a simplifying assumption, we ignore the attention operation, as it typically uses less than 10% of the total compute for the models we are analyzing.</p><p>Calculations can be seen in  Next we note that since T5 uses an encoder-decoder model, only half of the parameters are active for each token during a forward or backwards pass. We then note that each token is involved in a single addition and a single multiply for each active parameter in the forward pass (ignoring attention). Then we add a multiplier of 3x to account for the backwards pass (as computing both ∂params ∂loss and ∂acts ∂loss use a similar amount of compute as the forwards pass. Combining the previous two numbers, we get the total flops per parameter per token. We multiply this value by the total training tokens and the total parameters to yield the number of total flops used during training. We report both flops and petaflop/s-day (each of which are 8.64e+19 flops).</p></div>\n",

We first describe the experiments on the ∼ 200 word news articles, and then describe the preliminary investigation of ∼ 500 word news articles generated by GPT-3.</p><p>Participants: We recruited 718 unique participants to take part in 6 experiments. 97 participants were excluded for failing an internet check question, leaving a total of 621 participants: 343 male, 271 female, and 7 other. Mean participant age was ∼ 38 years old. All participants were recruited through Positly, which maintains a whitelist of high-performing workers from Mechanical Turk. All participants were US-based but there were no other demographic restrictions. Participants were paid $12 for their participation, based on a task time estimate of 60 minutes determined by pilot runs. In order to ensure that the sample of participants for each experiment quiz was unique, participants were not allowed to take part in an experiment more than once.</p><p>Procedure and design: We arbitrarily selected 25 news articles that appeared in newser.com in early 2020. We used the article titles and subtitles to produce outputs from the 125M, 350M, 760M, 1.3B, 2.7B, 6.7B, 13.0B, and 200B (GPT-3) parameter language models. Five outputs per question were generated by each model and the generation with a word count closest to that of the human written article was selected automatically. This was to minimize the effect that completion length might have on participants' judgments. The same output procedure for each model with the exception of the removal of the intentionally bad control model, as described in the main text.  In each experiment, half of the participants were randomly assigned to quiz A and half were randomly assigned to quiz B. Each quiz consisted of 25 articles: half (12-13) were human written and half (12-13) were model generated: the articles with human written completions in quiz A had model generated completions in quiz B and vice versa. The order of quiz question was shuffled for each participant. Participants could leave comments and were asked to indicate if they had seen the articles before. Participants were instructed not to look up the articles or their content during the quiz and at the end of the quiz were asked if they had looked anything up during the quiz.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Statistical Tests:</head><p>To compare means on the different runs, we performed a two-sample t-test for independent groups for each model against the control. This was implemented in Python using the scipy.stats.ttest_ind function. When plotting a regression line in the graph of average participant accuracy vs model size, we fit a power law of the form ax −b . The 95% confidence intervals were estimated from the t-distribution of the sample mean.</p><p>Duration statistics: In the main text, we discussed the finding that the ability of human participants to distinguish model and human generated news articles decreases as our models become larger. We have also found that the average time spent for a given set of questions increases as the model size increases, as shown in  accuracy scores despite increased time investment from participants supports the finding that larger models generate harder-to-distinguish news articles.</p><p>Preliminary investigation of ∼ 500 word articles: We recruited 160 unique US-based participants to take part in 2 experiments through Positly (details are given in Table <ref type=\"table\">E</ref>.2). We randomly selected 12 Reuters world news articles from late 2019 and created a context for GPT-3 175B that consisted of a single Reuters article not in this set of 12. We then used the article titles and Reuters locations to generate completions from GPT-3 175B and the 160M control model from the previous experiments. These were used to create two 12-question quizzes per model, each consisting of half human written and half model generated articles. Comprehension questions were added and articles were shown to participants in 3 stages at 30 second intervals to encourage closer reading. Participants were paid $12 for this task. Model generation selection methods, exclusion criteria, and statistical tests mirror those of the previous experiments.</p><p>F Additional Samples from GPT-3</p><p>GPT-3 adapts well to many tasks other than the ones explored in the main body of the paper. As an example, in Figure F.1, we show four uncurated samples from a prompt suggesting that the model write a poem, with a given title, in the style of Wallace Stevens. We first experimented with a few prompts, then generated four samples with no additional editing or selection (sampling at temperature 1 using nucleus sampling <ref target=\"#b62\" type=\"bibr\">[HBFC19]</ref> with P = 0.9). Completions were truncated when the model began to write a new title and author heading, or broke into prose commentary.</p></div>\n",

The normal force here represents the force applied by the table against the object that prevents it from sinking through the table and requires that the table is sturdy enough to deliver this normal force without breaking. However, it is easy to assume that the normal force and weight are action-reaction force pairs (a common mistake). In this case, the normal force and weight need to be equal in magnitude to explain why there is no upward acceleration of the object. For example, a ball that bounces upwards accelerates upwards because the normal force acting on the ball is larger in magnitude than the weight of the ball. question: is the normal force equal to the force of gravity? answer:</p><p>Target Completion → yes</p></div>\n",

GPT-3 175B achieves 85 F1 in the few-shot setting, only a few points behind measured human performance and state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. Zero-shot and one-shot performance is a few points behind, with the gains to few-shot being largest for bigger models.Figure 3.8: Performance on SuperGLUE increases with model size and number of examples in context. A value of K = 32 means that our model was shown 32 examples per task, for 256 examples total divided across the 8 tasks in SuperGLUE. We report GPT-3 values on the dev set, so our numbers are not directly comparable to the dotted reference lines (our test set results are in Table 3.8). The BERT-Large reference model was fine-tuned on the SuperGLUE training set (125K examples), whereas BERT++ was first fine-tuned on MultiNLI (392K examples) and SWAG (113K examples) before further fine-tuning on the SuperGLUE training set (for a total of 630K fine-tuning examples). We find the difference in performance between the BERT-Large and BERT++ to be roughly equivalent to the difference between GPT-3 with one example per context versus eight examples per context. and MultiRC, we sampled a new set of examples to use in the context for each problem. For WSC and MultiRC, we used the same set of randomly drawn examples from the training set as context for all of the problems we evaluated.</note></figure>\n",

One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling up parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size: 213 million parameters [VSP + 17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [DCLT18], 1.5 billion parameters [RWC + 19], 8 billion parameters [SPP + 19], 11 billion parameters [RSR + 19], and most recently 17 billion parameters<ref target=\"#b152\" type=\"bibr\">[Tur20]</ref>. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of increasing models' capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the conditional computation framework<ref target=\"#b33\" type=\"bibr\">[BLC13]</ref> and specifically, the mixture-of-experts method [SMM + 17] has been used to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [AJF19], though only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases computation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time<ref target=\"#b58\" type=\"bibr\">[Gra16]</ref> and the universal transformer[DGV + 18]. Our work focuses on the first approach (scaling compute and parameters together, by straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ this strategy.Several efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance.

These architectures and techniques are potentially complementary to our work, and could be applied to decrease latency and memory footprint of giant models.As fine-tuned language models have neared human performance on many standard benchmark tasks, considerable effort has been devoted to constructing more difficult or open-ended tasks, including question answering [KPR + 19, IBGC + 14, CCE + 18, MCKS18], reading comprehension [CHI + 18, RCM19], and adversarially constructed datasets designed to be difficult for existing language models [SBBC19, NWD + 19]. In this work we test our models on many of these datasets.Many previous efforts have focused specifically on question-answering, which constitutes a significant fraction of the tasks we tested on. Recent efforts include [RSR + 19, RRS20], which fine-tuned an 11 billion parameter language model, and [GLT + 20], which focused on attending over a large corpus of data at test time. Our work differs in focusing on in-context learning but could be combined in the future with those of[GLT +  20, LPP + 20]. Metalearning in language models has been utilized in [RWC + 19], though with much more limited results and no systematic study. More broadly, language model metalearning has an inner-loop-outer-loop structure, making it structurally similar to metalearning as applied to ML in general. Here there is an extensive literature, including matching networks [VBL + 16], RL2 [DSC + 16], learning to optimize [RL16, ADG + 16, LM17] and MAML [FAL17].</figDesc><table/><note>Our approach of stuffing the model's context with previous examples is most structurally similar to RL2 and also resembles<ref target=\"#b67\" type=\"bibr\">[HYC01]</ref>, in that an inner loop of adaptation takes place through computation in the model's activations across timesteps, without updating the weights, while an outer loop (in this case just language model pre-training) updates the weights, and implicitly learns the ability to adapt to or at least recognize tasks defined at inference-time.

Formatted dataset example for Cycled Letters Context → Passage: Saint Jean de Brébeuf was a French Jesuit missionary who travelled to New France in 1625. There he worked primarily with the Huron for the rest of his life, except for a few years in France from 1629 to 1633. He learned their language and culture, writing extensively about each to aid other missionaries. In 1649, Brébeuf and another missionary were captured when an Iroquois raid took over a Huron village . Together with Huron captives, the missionaries were ritually tortured and killed on March 16, 1649. Brébeuf was beatified in 1925 and among eight Jesuit missionaries canonized as saints in the Roman Catholic Church in 1930. Formatted dataset example for Natural Questions Context → TITLE: William Perry (American football) -Professional career PARAGRAPH: In 1985, he was selected in the first round of the 1985 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears; he had been hand-picked by coach Mike Ditka.However, defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, who had a highly acrimonious relationship with Ditka, called Perry a \"wasted draft-pick\". Perry soon became a pawn in the political power struggle between Ditka and Ryan. Perry's \"Refrigerator\" nickname followed him into the NFL and he quickly became a favorite of the Chicago Bears fans. Teammates called him \"Biscuit,\" as in \"one biscuit shy of 350 pounds.\" While Ryan refused to play Perry, Ditka decided to use Perry as a fullback when the team was near the opponents' goal line or in fourth and short situations, either as a ball carrier or a lead blocker for star running back Walter Payton. Ditka stated the inspiration for using Perry as a fullback came to him during five-yard sprint exercises. During his rookie season, Perry rushed for two touchdowns and caught a pass for one. Perry even had the opportunity to run the ball during Super Bowl XX, as a nod to his popularity and contributions to the team's success. The first time he got the ball, he was tackled for a one-yard loss while attempting to throw his first NFL pass on a halfback option play. The second time he got the ball, he scored a touchdown (running over Patriots linebacker Larry McGrew in the process). About halfway through his rookie season, Ryan finally began to play Perry, who soon proved that he was a capable defensive lineman. His Super Bowl ring size is the largest of any professional football player in the history of the event. His ring size is 25, while the ring size for the average adult male is between 10 and 12. Perry went on to play for ten years in the NFL, retiring after the 1994 season. In his ten years as a pro, he regularly struggled with his weight, which hampered his performance at times. He played in 138 games, recording 29.5 sacks and five fumble recoveries, which he returned for a total of 71 yards. In his offensive career he ran five yards for two touchdowns, and had one reception for another touchdown. Perry later attempted a comeback, playing an unremarkable 1996 season with the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football (later NFL Europa).</figDesc><table><row><cell>Q: what is the most populous municipality in Finland?

       " <note n=\"1\" place=\"foot\" xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In the context of language models this has sometimes been called \"zero-shot transfer\", but this term is potentially ambiguous: the method is \"zero-shot\" in the sense that no gradient updates are performed, but it often involves providing inference-time demonstrations to the model, so is not truly learning from zero examples. To avoid this confusion, we use the term \"meta-learning\" to capture the inner-loop / outer-loop structure of the general method, and the term \"in context-learning\" to refer to the inner loop of meta-learning. We further specialize the description to \"zero-shot\", \"one-shot\", or \"few-shot\" depending on how many demonstrations are provided at inference time. These terms are intended to remain agnostic on the question of whether the model learns new tasks from scratch at inference time or simply recognizes patterns seen during training -this is an important issue which we discuss later in the paper, but \"meta-learning\" is intended to encompass both possibilities, and simply describes the inner-outer loop structure.</note>\n",

       " <note n=\"3\" place=\"foot\" xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">This task is also relevant to the potential misuse of language models discussed in Section 6.1.4  We wanted to identify how good an average person on the internet is at detecting language model outputs, so we focused on participants drawn from the general US population. See Appendix E for details.</note>\n",
       " <note n=\"5\" place=\"foot\" xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">We use a two-sample Student's T-Test to test for significant difference between the means of the participant accuracies of each model and the control model and report the normalized difference in the means (as the t-statistic) and the p-value.6  If a model consistently produces texts that are more impressive than human articles, it is possible that human performance on this task would drop below 50%. Indeed, many individual participants scored below 50% on this task.7 Additional non-news samples can be found in Appendix F.</note>\n",
       " <note n=\"8\" place=\"foot\" xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Evaluating fairness, bias, and representation in language models is a rapidly-developing area with a large body of prior work. See, for example, [HZJ + 19, NBR20, SCNP19].</note>\n",
       " <note n=\"9\" place=\"foot\" xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">We only used male and female pronouns. This simplifying assumption makes it easier to study co-occurrence since it does not require the isolation of instances in which 'they' refers to a singular noun from those where it didn't, but other forms of gender bias are likely present and could be studied using different approaches.</note>\n",

The footsteps, and Intrusive than the bluish snow</p><p>The grasses in that light, and in the shade That falls on all of us. I must have</p><p>The menacing life. Grey thoughts and blue thoughts walk with me If I am to go away at all.</p><p>We played, too, once, in the warmest rooms.</p><p>To one content, there is one content --------Generated Poem 2 --------For all mankind. The forest glades Are all the more for being in fable, There is a way in the world.</p><p>And wood and town in legend shadowed-That way a man may live in a small town Once more to return. The one content His lifetime and see no man come, Has in it every happiness, more brave Never the stir of men about a market, For being purposeless; and so Never the bobbing of covered carts, Those island gardens, deep in the mind, Never the creak passed on the stair Make of remoteness familiarity Closing some other life; an old man And of the unspoken name a friend. Can prosper in that town, can prosper When his store is seen to close, his wife --------Generated Poem 4 --------Fades in his house, and the world shouts in vain That no one comes to hear him Nobody will come to this place. It is a road that leads nowhere. Where his small bell tolls.</p><p>The solitude is deep. The mountains are high. In that small town But they are desolate, and they turn the traveler's face Everything is known.</p><p>Towards the North. All the sounds of the world are far away. The ways of the young men are known, When the wind rises above the trees, And the ways of the young women</p><p>The boughs bow to the ground. As they walk to the Spring;</p><p>Even the birds that inhabit the tangle of weeds The rumors are all known, That is the roadside cover, are silent. One listens, The quarrels, the hurt, the envy But hears no roar of the forest. One is alone. Of the men and the women.</p><p>One will be taken. Till a day comes One will be taken.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>That way out of the world</head><p>There is no utterance, there is no conversation, That leads to a wood.</p><p>But one is uneasy all the same.... Young, the young man There is a thin blue mist, Walks, a lover now, A darkness rising like smoke, Knows the streets as they are and is of them.</p><p>And within that darkness A possession of the heart. Comes to the wood.</p><p>One will be taken.... It was here, and it will be here again-Here, under this sky empty and full of light. There, in the wood, among trees, He sees shadows on the way, hears voices, hears the wind and the rustling of leaves; Through an open glade He sees a shape and the shape hears: It waits as he waits, Waits as the shadows wait, As the voices wait; Shadows on the way, voices in the wind. </p></div> </div>\n",

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><p>An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pretraining on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pretrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than finetuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA. * Equal contribution. 0 Compared to V1, this draft includes better baselines, experiments on GLUE, and more on adapter latency. 1 While GPT-3 175B achieves non-trivial performance with few-shot learning, fine-tuning boosts its performance significantly as shown in Appendix A.</p></div>\n",

We only train A and B.</p><p>Many applications in natural language processing rely on adapting one large-scale, pre-trained language model to multiple downstream applications. Such adaptation is usually done via fine-tuning, which updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model. The major downside of fine-tuning is that the new model contains as many parameters as in the original model. As larger models are trained every few months, this changes from a mere \"inconvenience\" for GPT-2 <ref type=\"bibr\">(Radford et al., b)</ref> or RoBERTa large <ref target=\"#b35\" type=\"bibr\">(Liu et al., 2019)</ref> to a critical deployment challenge for GPT-3 <ref type=\"bibr\">(Brown et al., 2020)</ref> with 175 billion trainable parameters. <ref type=\"bibr\">1</ref> Many sought to mitigate this by adapting only some parameters or learning external modules for new tasks. This way, we only need to store and load a small number of task-specific parameters in addition to the pre-trained model for each task, greatly boosting the operational efficiency when deployed. However, existing techniques often introduce inference latency <ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">(Houlsby et al., 2019;</ref><ref target=\"#b47\" type=\"bibr\">Rebuffi et al., 2017</ref>) by extending model depth or reduce the model's usable sequence length <ref target=\"#b29\" type=\"bibr\">(Li &amp; Liang, 2021;</ref><ref target=\"#b20\" type=\"bibr\">Hambardzumyan et al., 2020;</ref>) (Section 3). More importantly, these method often fail to match the fine-tuning baselines, posing a trade-off between efficiency and model quality.</p><p>We take inspiration from <ref target=\"#b28\" type=\"bibr\">Li et al. (2018a)</ref>; <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">Aghajanyan et al. (2020)</ref> which show that the learned over-parametrized models in fact reside on a low intrinsic dimension. We hypothesize that the change in weights during model adaptation also has a low \"intrinsic rank\", leading to our proposed Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach. LoRA allows us to train some dense layers in a neural network indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers' change during adaptation instead, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen, as shown in Figure <ref type=\"figure\">1</ref>. Using GPT-3 175B as an example, we show that a very low rank (i.e., r in Figure <ref type=\"figure\">1</ref> can be one or two) suffices even when the full rank (i.e., d) is as high as 12,288, making LoRA both storage-and compute-efficient.</p><p>LoRA possesses several key advantages.</p><p>• A pre-trained model can be shared and used to build many small LoRA modules for different tasks. We can freeze the shared model and efficiently switch tasks by replacing the matrices A and B in Figure <ref type=\"figure\">1</ref>, reducing the storage requirement and task-switching overhead significantly.</p><p>• LoRA makes training more efficient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3 times when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or maintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected, much smaller low-rank matrices.</p><p>• Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights when deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully fine-tuned model, by construction.</p><p>• LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such as prefix-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Terminologies and Conventions</head><p>We make frequent references to the Transformer architecture and use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions. We call the input and output dimension size of a Transformer layer d model . We use W q , W k , W v , and W o to refer to the query/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. W or W 0 refers to a pretrained weight matrix and ∆W its accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use r to denote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by <ref target=\"#b52\" type=\"bibr\">(Vaswani et al., 2017;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">Brown et al., 2020)</ref> and use Adam <ref target=\"#b37\" type=\"bibr\">(Loshchilov &amp; Hutter, 2019;</ref><ref target=\"#b25\" type=\"bibr\">Kingma &amp; Ba, 2017)</ref> for model optimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension d f f n = 4 × d model .</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"2\">PROBLEM STATEMENT</head><p>While our proposal is agnostic to training objective, we focus on language modeling as our motivating use case. Below is a brief description of the language modeling problem and, in particular, the maximization of conditional probabilities given a task-specific prompt.</p><p>Suppose we are given a pre-trained autoregressive language model P Φ (y|x) parametrized by Φ.</p><p>For instance, P Φ (y|x) can be a generic multi-task learner such as GPT <ref type=\"bibr\">(Radford et al., b;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">Brown et al., 2020)</ref> based on the Transformer architecture <ref target=\"#b52\" type=\"bibr\">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>. Consider adapting this pre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine reading comprehension (MRC), and natural language to SQL (NL2SQL). Each downstream task is represented by a training dataset of context-target pairs: Z = {(x i , y i )} i=1,..,N , where both x i and y i are sequences of tokens. For example, in NL2SQL, x i is a natural language query and y i its corresponding SQL command; for summarization, x i is the content of an article and y i its summary.</p><p>During full fine-tuning, the model is initialized to pre-trained weights Φ 0 and updated to Φ 0 + ∆Φ by repeatedly following the gradient to maximize the conditional language modeling objective:</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_1\">max Φ (x,y)∈Z |y| t=1 log (P Φ (y t |x, y &lt;t )) (1)</formula><p>One of the main drawbacks for full fine-tuning is that for each downstream task, we learn a different set of parameters ∆Φ whose dimension |∆Φ| equals |Φ 0 |. Thus, if the pre-trained model is large (such as GPT-3 with |Φ 0 | ≈ 175 Billion), storing and deploying many independent instances of fine-tuned models can be challenging, if at all feasible.</p><p>In this paper, we adopt a more parameter-efficient approach, where the task-specific parameter increment ∆Φ = ∆Φ(Θ) is further encoded by a much smaller-sized set of parameters Θ with |Θ| |Φ 0 |. The task of finding ∆Φ thus becomes optimizing over Θ:</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_2\">max Θ (x,y)∈Z |y| t=1 log p Φ0+∆Φ(Θ) (y t |x, y &lt;t )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In the subsequent sections, we propose to use a low-rank representation to encode ∆Φ that is both compute-and memory-efficient. When the pre-trained model is GPT-3 175B, the number of trainable parameters |Θ| can be as small as 0.01% of |Φ 0 |.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3\">AREN'T EXISTING SOLUTIONS GOOD ENOUGH?</head><p>The problem we set out to tackle is by no means new. Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens of works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter-and compute-efficient. See Section 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there are two prominent strategies when it comes to efficient adaptations: adding adapter layers <ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">(Houlsby et al., 2019;</ref><ref target=\"#b47\" type=\"bibr\">Rebuffi et al., 2017;</ref><ref target=\"#b42\" type=\"bibr\">Pfeiffer et al., 2021;</ref><ref target=\"#b48\" type=\"bibr\">Rücklé et al., 2020)</ref> or optimizing some forms of the input layer activations <ref target=\"#b29\" type=\"bibr\">(Li &amp; Liang, 2021;</ref><ref target=\"#b20\" type=\"bibr\">Hambardzumyan et al., 2020;</ref>. However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and latency-sensitive production scenario.</p><p>Adapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency There are many variants of adapters. We focus on the original design by <ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">Houlsby et al. (2019)</ref> which has two adapter layers per Transformer block and a more recent one by <ref target=\"#b33\" type=\"bibr\">Lin et al. (2020)</ref> which has only one per block but with an additional LayerNorm <ref target=\"#b5\" type=\"bibr\">(Ba et al., 2016)</ref>. While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploiting multi-task settings <ref target=\"#b48\" type=\"bibr\">(Rücklé et al., 2020;</ref><ref target=\"#b42\" type=\"bibr\">Pfeiffer et al., 2021)</ref>, there is no direct ways to bypass the extra compute in adapter layers. This seems like a non-issue since adapter layers are designed to have few parameters (sometimes &lt;1% of the original model) by having a small bottleneck dimension, which limits the FLOPs they can add. However, large neural networks rely on hardware parallelism to keep the latency low, and adapter layers have to be processed sequentially. This makes a difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a generic scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 <ref type=\"bibr\">(Radford et al., b)</ref> medium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a very small bottleneck dimension (Table <ref target=\"#tab_1\" type=\"table\">1</ref>).</p><p>This problem gets worse when we need to shard the model as done in <ref target=\"#b50\" type=\"bibr\">Shoeybi et al. (2020)</ref>; <ref target=\"#b26\" type=\"bibr\">Lepikhin et al. (2020)</ref>, because the additional depth requires more synchronous GPU operations such as AllReduce and Broadcast, unless we store the adapter parameters redundantly many times.</p><p>Directly Optimizing the Prompt is Hard The other direction, as exemplified by prefix tuning <ref target=\"#b29\" type=\"bibr\">(Li &amp; Liang, 2021)</ref>, faces a different challenge. We observe that prefix tuning is difficult to optimize and that its performance changes non-monotonically in trainable parameters, confirming similar observations in the original paper. More fundamentally, reserving a part of the sequence length for adaptation necessarily reduces the sequence length available to process a downstream task, which we suspect makes tuning the prompt less performant compared to other methods. We defer the study on task performance to Section 5.  </p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"4\">OUR METHOD</head><p>We describe the simple design of LoRA and its practical benefits. The principles outlined here apply to any dense layers in deep learning models, though we only focus on certain weights in Transformer language models in our experiments as the motivating use case.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"4.1\">LOW-RANK-PARAMETRIZED UPDATE MATRICES</head><p>A neural network contains many dense layers which perform matrix multiplication. The weight matrices in these layers typically have full-rank. When adapting to a specific task, <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">Aghajanyan et al. (2020)</ref> shows that the pre-trained language models have a low \"instrisic dimension\" and can still learn efficiently despite a random projection to a smaller subspace. Inspired by this, we hypothesize the updates to the weights also have a low \"intrinsic rank\" during adaptation. For a pre-trained weight matrix W 0 ∈ R d×k , we constrain its update by representing the latter with a low-rank decomposition W 0 + ∆W = W 0 + BA, where B ∈ R d×r , A ∈ R r×k , and the rank r min(d, k). During training, W 0 is frozen and does not receive gradient updates, while A and B contain trainable parameters. Note both W 0 and ∆W = BA are multiplied with the same input, and their respective output vectors are summed coordinate-wise. For h = W 0 x, our modified forward pass yields:</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_3\">h = W 0 x + ∆W x = W 0 x + BAx (3)</formula><p>We illustrate our reparametrization in Figure <ref type=\"figure\">1</ref>. We use a random Gaussian initialization for A and zero for B, so ∆W = BA is zero at the beginning of training. We then scale ∆W x by α r , where α is a constant in r. When optimizing with Adam, tuning α is roughly the same as tuning the learning rate if we scale the initialization appropriately. As a result, we simply set α to the first r we try and do not tune it. This scaling helps to reduce the need to retune hyperparameters when we vary r <ref target=\"#b58\" type=\"bibr\">(Yang &amp; Hu, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>A Generalization of Full Fine-tuning. A more general form of fine-tuning allows the training of a subset of the pre-trained parameters. LoRA takes a step further and does not require the accumulated gradient update to weight matrices to have full-rank during adaptation. This means that when applying LoRA to all weight matrices and training all biases 2 , we roughly recover the expressiveness of full fine-tuning by setting the LoRA rank r to the rank of the pre-trained weight matrices. In other words, as we increase the number of trainable parameters 3 , training LoRA roughly converges to training the original model, while adapter-based methods converges to an MLP and prefix-based methods to a model that cannot take long input sequences.</p><p>No Additional Inference Latency. When deployed in production, we can explicitly compute and store W = W 0 + BA and perform inference as usual. Note that both W 0 and BA are in R d×k . When we need to switch to another downstream task, we can recover W 0 by subtracting BA and then adding a different B A , a quick operation with very little memory overhead. Critically, this guarantees that we do not introduce any additional latency during inference compared to a fine-tuned model by construction.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"4.2\">APPLYING LORA TO TRANSFORMER</head><p>In principle, we can apply LoRA to any subset of weight matrices in a neural network to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In the Transformer architecture, there are four weight matrices in the self-attention module (W q , W k , W v , W o ) and two in the MLP module. We treat W q (or W k , W v ) as a single matrix of dimension d model × d model , even though the output dimension is usually sliced into attention heads. We limit our study to only adapting the attention weights for downstream tasks and freeze the MLP modules (so they are not trained in downstream tasks) both for simplicity and parameter-efficiency.We further study the effect on adapting different types of attention weight matrices in a Transformer in Section 7.1. We leave the empirical investigation of adapting the MLP layers, LayerNorm layers, and biases to a future work.</p><p>Practical Benefits and Limitations. The most significant benefit comes from the reduction in memory and storage usage. For a large Transformer trained with Adam, we reduce that VRAM usage by up to 2/3 if r d model as we do not need to store the optimizer states for the frozen parameters. On GPT-3 175B, we reduce the VRAM consumption during training from 1.2TB to 350GB. With r = 4 and only the query and value projection matrices being adapted, the checkpoint size is reduced by roughly 10,000× (from 350GB to 35MB) 4 . This allows us to train with significantly fewer GPUs and avoid I/O bottlenecks. Another benefit is that we can switch between tasks while deployed at a much lower cost by only swapping the LoRA weights as opposed to all the parameters. This allows for the creation of many customized models that can be swapped in and out on the fly on machines that store the pre-trained weights in VRAM. We also observe a 25% speedup during training on GPT-3 175B compared to full fine-tuning 5 as we do not need to calculate the gradient for the vast majority of the parameters.</p><p>LoRA also has its limitations. For example, it is not straightforward to batch inputs to different tasks with different A and B in a single forward pass, if one chooses to absorb A and B into W to eliminate additional inference latency. Though it is possible to not merge the weights and dynamically choose the LoRA modules to use for samples in a batch for scenarios where latency is not critical.</p></div>\n",

Our experiments cover a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding (NLU) to generation (NLG). Specifically, we evaluate on the GLUE <ref target=\"#b53\" type=\"bibr\">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref> benchmark for RoBERTa and DeBERTa. We follow the setup of <ref target=\"#b29\" type=\"bibr\">Li &amp; Liang (2021)</ref> on GPT-2 for a direct comparison and add WikiSQL <ref target=\"#b62\" type=\"bibr\">(Zhong et al., 2017)</ref> (NL to SQL queries) and SAMSum <ref target=\"#b17\" type=\"bibr\">(Gliwa et al., 2019)</ref> (conversation summarization) for large-scale experiments on GPT-3.

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"5.1\">BASELINES</head><p>To compare with other baselines broadly, we replicate the setups used by prior work and reuse their reported numbers whenever possible. This, however, means that some baselines might only appear in certain experiments.</p><p>Fine-Tuning (FT) is a common approach for adaptation. During fine-tuning, the model is initialized to the pre-trained weights and biases, and all model parameters undergo gradient updates.A simple variant is to update only some layers while freezing others. We include one such baseline reported in prior work <ref target=\"#b29\" type=\"bibr\">(Li &amp; Liang, 2021</ref>) on GPT-2, which adapts just the last two layers (FT Top2 ).  Bias-only or BitFit is a baseline where we only train the bias vectors while freezing everything else. Contemporarily, this baseline has also been studied by <ref type=\"bibr\">BitFit (Zaken et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Prefix-embedding tuning (PreEmbed) inserts special tokens among the input tokens. These special tokens have trainable word embeddings and are generally not in the model's vocabulary. Where to place such tokens can have an impact on performance. We focus on \"prefixing\", which prepends such tokens to the prompt, and \"infixing\", which appends to the prompt; both are discussed in <ref target=\"#b29\" type=\"bibr\">Li &amp; Liang (2021)</ref>. We use l p (resp. l i ) denote the number of prefix (resp. infix) tokens. The number of trainable parameters is |Θ| = d model × (l p + l i ).</p><p>Prefix-layer tuning (PreLayer) is an extension to prefix-embedding tuning. Instead of just learning the word embeddings (or equivalently, the activations after the embedding layer) for some special tokens, we learn the activations after every Transformer layer. The activations computed from previous layers are simply replaced by trainable ones. The resulting number of trainable parameters is</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_4\">|Θ| = L × d model × (l p + l i ),</formula><p>where L is the number of Transformer layers.</p><p>Adapter tuning as proposed in <ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">Houlsby et al. (2019)</ref> inserts adapter layers between the selfattention module (and the MLP module) and the subsequent residual connection. There are two fully connected layers with biases in an adapter layer with a nonlinearity in between. We call this original design Adapter H . Recently, <ref target=\"#b33\" type=\"bibr\">Lin et al. (2020)</ref> proposed a more efficient design with the adapter layer applied only after the MLP module and after a LayerNorm. We call it Adapter L .

Due to the high training cost, we only report the typical standard deviation for a given task over random seeds, as opposed to providing one for every entry. See Section D.4 for details on the hyperparameters used.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type=\"table\">4</ref>, LoRA matches or exceeds the fine-tuning baseline on all three datasets. Note that not all methods benefit monotonically from having more trainable parameters, as shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_0\" type=\"figure\">2</ref>. We observe a significant performance drop when we use more than 256 special tokens for prefix-embedding tuning or more than 32 special tokens for prefix-layer tuning. This corroborates similar observations in <ref target=\"#b29\" type=\"bibr\">Li &amp; Liang (2021)</ref>. While a thorough investigation into this phenomenon is out-of-scope for this work, we suspect that having more special tokens causes the input distribution to shift further away from the pre-training data distribution. Separately, we investigate the performance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime in Section F.3.  Prompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning. While GPT-3 175B can adapt its behavior with just a few additional training examples, the result depends heavily on the input prompt <ref type=\"bibr\">(Brown et al., 2020)</ref>. This necessitates an empirical art of composing and formatting the prompt to maximize a model's performance on a desired task, which is known as prompt engineering or prompt hacking.  <ref type=\"formula\">2008</ref>), yet practitioners often retrain all of them to maximize the downstream performance. However, the enormity of GPT-3 175B makes it challenging to perform fine-tuning in the usual way due to the large checkpoint it produces and the high hardware barrier to entry since it has the same memory footprint as pre-training.</p><p>Parameter-Efficient Adaptation. Many have proposed inserting adapter layers between existing layers in a neural network <ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">(Houlsby et al., 2019;</ref><ref target=\"#b47\" type=\"bibr\">Rebuffi et al., 2017;</ref><ref target=\"#b33\" type=\"bibr\">Lin et al., 2020)</ref>. Our method uses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates. The key functional difference is that our learned weights can be merged with the main weights during inference, thus not introducing any latency, which is not the case for the adapter layers (Section 3).</p><p>A comtenporary extension of adapter is COMPACTER <ref target=\"#b38\" type=\"bibr\">(Mahabadi et al., 2021)</ref>, which essentially parametrizes the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing scheme. Similarly, combining LoRA with other tensor product-based methods could potentially improve its parameter efficiency, which we leave to future work. More recently, many proposed optimizing the input word embeddings in lieu of fine-tuning, akin to a continuous and differentiable generalization of prompt engineering <ref target=\"#b29\" type=\"bibr\">(Li &amp; Liang, 2021;</ref><ref target=\"#b20\" type=\"bibr\">Hambardzumyan et al., 2020;</ref>. We include comparisons with <ref target=\"#b29\" type=\"bibr\">Li &amp; Liang (2021)</ref> in our experiment section. However, this line of works can only scale up by using more special tokens in the prompt, which take up available sequence length for task tokens when positional embeddings are learned.</p><p>Low-Rank Structures in Deep Learning. Low-rank structure is very common in machine learning. A lot of machine learning problems have certain intrinsic low-rank structure <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">Cai et al., 2010;</ref><ref target=\"#b32\" type=\"bibr\">Li et al., 2018b;</ref><ref target=\"#b18\" type=\"bibr\">Grasedyck et al., 2013)</ref>. Moreover, it is known that for many deep learning tasks, especially those with a heavily over-parametrized neural network, the learned neural network will enjoy low-rank properties after training <ref target=\"#b41\" type=\"bibr\">(Oymak et al., 2019)</ref>. Some prior works even explicitly impose the low-rank constraint when training the original neural network <ref target=\"#b49\" type=\"bibr\">(Sainath et al., 2013;</ref><ref target=\"#b43\" type=\"bibr\">Povey et al., 2018;</ref><ref target=\"#b60\" type=\"bibr\">Zhang et al., 2014;</ref><ref target=\"#b23\" type=\"bibr\">Jaderberg et al., 2014;</ref><ref target=\"#b61\" type=\"bibr\">Zhao et al., 2016;</ref><ref target=\"#b24\" type=\"bibr\">Khodak et al., 2021;</ref><ref target=\"#b11\" type=\"bibr\">Denil et al., 2014)</ref>; however, to the best of our knowledge, none of these works considers low-rank update to a frozen model for adaptation to downstream tasks. In theory literature, it is known that neural networks outperform other classical learning methods, including the corresponding (finite-width) neural tangent kernels <ref target=\"#b30\" type=\"bibr\">Li &amp; Liang, 2018)</ref> when the underlying concept class has certain low-rank structure <ref target=\"#b16\" type=\"bibr\">(Ghorbani et al., 2020;</ref><ref target=\"#b2\" type=\"bibr\">Allen-Zhu &amp; Li, 2020a)</ref>.

We set a parameter budget of 18M (roughly 35MB if stored in FP16) on GPT-3 175B, which corresponds to r = 8 if we adapt one type of attention weights or r = 4 if we adapt two types, for all 96 layers. The result is presented in Table <ref type=\"table\">5</ref>. Table <ref type=\"table\">5</ref>: Validation accuracy on WikiSQL and MultiNLI after applying LoRA to different types of attention weights in GPT-3, given the same number of trainable parameters.

This suggests the update matrix ∆W could have a very small \"intrinsic rank\". <ref type=\"bibr\">6</ref> To further support this finding, we check the overlap of the subspaces learned by different choices of r and by different random seeds.

Given A r=8 and A r=64 which are the learned adaptation matrices with rank r = 8 and 64 using the same pre-trained model, we perform singular value decomposition and obtain the right-singular unitary matrices U Ar=8 and U Ar=64 . <ref type=\"bibr\">7</ref> We hope to answer: how much of the subspace spanned by the top i singular vectors in U Ar=8 (for 1 ≤ i ≤ 8) is contained in the subspace spanned by top j singular vectors of U Ar=64 (for 1 ≤ j ≤ 64)? We measure this quantity with a normalized subspace similarity based on the Grassmann distance (See Appendix G for a more formal discussion)</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_8\">φ(A r=8 , A r=64 , i, j) = ||U i Ar=8 U j Ar=64 || 2 F min(i, j) ∈ [0, 1]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where U i Ar=8 represents the columns of U Ar=8 corresponding to the top-i singular vectors. φ(•) has a range of [0, 1], where 1 represents a complete overlap of subspaces and 0 a complete separation. See Figure <ref target=\"#fig_2\" type=\"figure\">3</ref> for how φ changes as we vary i and j. We only look at the 48th layer (out of 96) due to space constraint, but the conclusion holds for other layers as well, as shown in Section H.1. We make an important observation from Figure <ref target=\"#fig_2\" type=\"figure\">3</ref>.</p><p>Directions corresponding to the top singular vector overlap significantly between A r=8 and A r=64 , while others do not. Specifically, ∆W v (resp. ∆W q ) of A r=8 and ∆W v (resp. ∆W q ) of A r=64 share a subspace of dimension 1 with normalized similarity &gt; 0.5, providing an explanation of why r = 1 performs quite well in our downstream tasks for GPT-3.</p><p>Since both A r=8 and A r=64 are learned using the same pre-trained model, Figure <ref target=\"#fig_2\" type=\"figure\">3</ref> indicates that the top singular-vector directions of A r=8 and A r=64 are the most useful, while other directions potentially contain mostly random noises accumulated during training. Hence, the adaptation matrix can indeed have a very low rank.</p><p>Subspace similarity between different random seeds. We further confirm this by plotting the normalized subspace similarity between two randomly seeded runs with r = 64, shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_3\" type=\"figure\">4</ref>. ∆W q appears to have a higher \"intrinsic rank\" than ∆W v , since more common singular value directions are learned by both runs for ∆W q , which is in line with our empirical observation in Table <ref type=\"table\">6</ref>.</p><p>As a comparison, we also plot two random Gaussian matrices, which do not share any common singular value directions with each other.  how \"large\" is ∆W comparing to its corresponding directions in W ?

First, ∆W has a stronger correlation with W compared to a random matrix, indicating that ∆W amplifies some features that are already in W . Second, instead of repeating the top singular directions of W , ∆W only amplifies directions that are not emphasized in W . Third, the amplification factor is rather huge: 21.5 ≈ 6.91/0.32 for r = 4. See Section H.4 for why r = 64 has a smaller amplification factor. We also provide a visualization in Section H.3 for how the correlation changes as we include more top singular directions from W q .

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"8\">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Fine-tuning enormous language models is prohibitively expensive in terms of the hardware required and the storage/switching cost for hosting independent instances for different tasks. We propose LoRA, an efficient adaptation strategy that neither introduces inference latency nor reduces input sequence length while retaining high model quality. Importantly, it allows for quick task-switching when deployed as a service by sharing the vast majority of the model parameters. While we focused on Transformer language models, the proposed principles are generally applicable to any neural networks with dense layers.</p><p>There are many directions for future works. 1) LoRA can be combined with other efficient adaptation methods, potentially providing orthogonal improvement.</p><p>2) The mechanism behind fine-tuning or LoRA is far from clear -how are features learned during pre-training transformed to do well on downstream tasks? We believe that LoRA makes it more tractable to answer this than full fine-tuning. 3) We mostly depend on heuristics to select the weight matrices to apply LoRA to. Are there more principled ways to do it? 4) Finally, the rank-deficiency of ∆W suggests that W could be rank-deficient as well, which can also be a source of inspiration for future works.

Consequently, adapter layers must be computed in addition to the base model, inevitably introducing additional latency. While as pointed out in <ref target=\"#b48\" type=\"bibr\">Rücklé et al. (2020)</ref>, the latency introduced by adapter layers can be mitigated when the model batch size and/or sequence length is large enough to full utilize the hardware parallelism. We confirm their observation with a similar latency study on GPT-2 medium and point out that there are scenarios, notably online inference where the batch size is small, where the added latency can be significant.</p><p>We measure the latency of a single forward pass on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000 by averaging over 100 trials. We vary the input batch size, sequence length, and the adapter bottleneck dimension r. We test two adapter designs: the original one by <ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">Houlsby et al.

The top row shows the result for Adapter H and the bottom row Adapter L . Larger batch size and sequence length help to mitigate the latency, but the slow-down can be as high as over 30% in an online, short-sequence-length scenario.

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>H.4 AMPLIFICATION FACTOR</head><p>One can naturally consider a feature amplification factor as the ratio ∆W F U W V F , where U and V are the left-and right-singular matrices of the SVD decomposition of ∆W . (Recall U U W V V gives the \"projection\" of W onto the subspace spanned by ∆W .) Intuitively, when ∆W mostly contains task-specific directions, this quantity measures how much of them are amplified by ∆W . As shown in Section 7.3, for r = 4, this amplification factor is as large as 20. In other words, there are (generally speaking) four feature directions in each layer (out of the entire feature space from the pre-trained model W ), that need to be amplified by a very large factor 20, in order to achieve our reported accuracy for the downstream specific task. And, one should expect a very different set of feature directions to be amplified for each different downstream task.</p><p>One may notice, however, for r = 64, this amplification factor is only around 2, meaning that most directions learned in ∆W with r = 64 are not being amplified by much. This should not be surprising, and in fact gives evidence (once again) that the intrinsic rank needed to represent the \"task-specific directions\" (thus for model adaptation) is low. In contrast, those directions in the rank-4 version of ∆W (corresponding to r = 4) are amplified by a much larger factor 20.

The variances of MET and TER are less than 0.01 for all the experiments we ran. \"U\" indicates unseen categories, \"S\" indicates seen categories, and \"A\" indicates all categories in the test set of WebNLG. F.2 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON GPT-3 We present additional runs on GPT-3 with different adaptation methods in Table 15. The focus is on identifying the trade-off between performance and the number of trainable parameters. F.3 LOW-DATA REGIME To evaluate the performance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime. we randomly sample 100, 1k and 10k training examples from the full training set of MNLI to form the low-data MNLI-n tasks. In Table 16, we show the performance of different adaptation approaches on MNLIn. To our surprise, PrefixEmbed and PrefixLayer performs very poorly on MNLI-100 dataset, with PrefixEmbed performing only slightly better than random chance (37.6% vs. 33.3%). PrefixLayer performs better than PrefixEmbed but is still significantly worse than Fine-Tune or LoRA on MNLI-100. The gap between prefix-based approaches and LoRA/Fine-tuning becomes smaller as we increase the number of training examples, which might suggest that prefix-based approaches are not suitable for low-data tasks in GPT-3. LoRA achieves better performance than fine-tuning on both MNLI-100 and MNLI-Full, and comparable results on MNLI-1k and MNLI-10K considering the (±0.3) variance due to random seeds. The training hyperparameters of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-n are reported in Table 17. We use a smaller learning rate for PrefixLayer on the MNLI-100 set, as the training loss does not decrease with a larger learning rate.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Method</cell><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell>WebNLG</cell><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell/></row><row><cell/><cell/><cell>BLEU↑</cell><cell/><cell cols=\"2\">MET↑</cell><cell/><cell/><cell>TER↓</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>U</cell><cell>S</cell><cell>A</cell><cell>U</cell><cell>S</cell><cell>A</cell><cell>U</cell><cell>S</cell><cell>A</cell></row><row><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell cols=\"3\">GPT-2 Medium</cell><cell/><cell/><cell/></row><row><cell>Fine-Tune (354M)</cell><cell>27.7</cell><cell>64.2</cell><cell>46.5</cell><cell cols=\"6\">.30 .45 .38 .76 .33 .53</cell></row><row><cell>Adapter L (0.37M)</cell><cell>45.1</cell><cell>54.5</cell><cell>50.2</cell><cell cols=\"6\">.36 .39 .38 .46 .40 .43</cell></row><row><cell>Adapter L (11M)</cell><cell>48.3</cell><cell>60.4</cell><cell>54.9</cell><cell cols=\"6\">.38 .43 .41 .45 .35 .39</cell></row><row><cell>FT Top2 (24M)</cell><cell>18.9</cell><cell>53.6</cell><cell>36.0</cell><cell cols=\"6\">.23 .38 .31 .99 .49 .72</cell></row><row><cell>Prefix (0.35M)</cell><cell>45.6</cell><cell>62.9</cell><cell>55.1</cell><cell cols=\"6\">.38 .44 .41 .49 .35 .40</cell></row><row><cell>LoRA (0.35M)</cell><cell cols=\"5\">46.7 GPT-2 Large</cell><cell/><cell/><cell/></row><row><cell>Fine-Tune (774M)</cell><cell>43.1</cell><cell>65.3</cell><cell>55.5</cell><cell cols=\"6\">.38 .46 .42 .53 .33 .42</cell></row><row><cell>Adapter L (0.Prefix (0.77M)</cell><cell>47.7</cell><cell>63.4</cell><cell>56.3</cell><cell cols=\"6\">.39 .45 .42 .48 .34 .40</cell></row><row><cell>LoRA (0.77M)</cell><cell>48.4</cell><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell/></row></table></figure>\n",

As shown in Table <ref type=\"table\">8</ref>, fine-tuning improves the model performance drastically compared to few-shot learning on datasets large and small. We take the GPT-3 few-shot result on RTE from the GPT-3 paper <ref type=\"bibr\">(Brown et al., 2020</ref>     where our similarity is defined as:</p><p>This similarity satisfies that if U i A and U j B share the same column span, then φ(A, B, i, j) = 1.

Unfortunately, the important role of humans is an oft-overlooked aspect in the field. Whether humans are directly using machine learning classifiers as tools, or are deploying models within other products, a vital concern remains: if the users do not trust a model or a prediction, they will not use it. It is important to differentiate between two different (but related) definitions of trust: (1) trusting a prediction, i.e. whether a user trusts an individual prediction sufficiently to take some action based on it, and (2) trusting a model, i.e. whether the user trusts a model to behave in reasonable ways if deployed. Both are directly impacted by Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Determining trust in individual predictions is an important problem when the model is used for decision making. When using machine learning for medical diagnosis <ref target=\"#b5\" type=\"bibr\">[6]</ref> or terrorism detection, for example, predictions cannot be acted upon on blind faith, as the consequences may be catastrophic.</p><p>Apart from trusting individual predictions, there is also a need to evaluate the model as a whole before deploying it \"in the wild\". To make this decision, users need to be confident that the model will perform well on real-world data, according to the metrics of interest. Currently, models are evaluated using accuracy metrics on an available validation dataset. However, real-world data is often significantly different, and further, the evaluation metric may not be indicative of the product's goal. Inspecting individual predictions and their explanations is a worthwhile solution, in addition to such metrics. In this case, it is important to aid users by suggesting which instances to inspect, especially for large datasets.</p><p>In this paper, we propose providing explanations for individual predictions as a solution to the \"trusting a prediction\" problem, and selecting multiple such predictions (and explanations) as a solution to the \"trusting the model\" problem. Our main contributions are summarized as follows.</p><p>• LIME, an algorithm that can explain the predictions of any classifier or regressor in a faithful way, by approximating it locally with an interpretable model.</p><p>• SP-LIME, a method that selects a set of representative instances with explanations to address the \"trusting the model\" problem, via submodular optimization.</p><p>• Comprehensive evaluation with simulated and human subjects, where we measure the impact of explanations on trust and associated tasks. In our experiments, non-experts using LIME are able to pick which classifier from a pair generalizes better in the real world. Further, they are able to greatly improve an untrustworthy classifier trained on 20 newsgroups, by doing feature engineering using LIME. We also show how understanding the predictions of a neural network on images helps practitioners know when and why they should not trust a model.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"2.\">THE CASE FOR EXPLANATIONS</head><p>By \"explaining a prediction\", we mean presenting textual or visual artifacts that provide qualitative understanding of the relationship between the instance's components (e.g. words in text, patches in an image) and the model's prediction. We argue that explaining predictions is an important aspect in  A model predicts that a patient has the flu, and LIME highlights the symptoms in the patient's history that led to the prediction. Sneeze and headache are portrayed as contributing to the \"flu\" prediction, while \"no fatigue\" is evidence against it. With these, a doctor can make an informed decision about whether to trust the model's prediction.</p><p>getting humans to trust and use machine learning effectively, if the explanations are faithful and intelligible. The process of explaining individual predictions is illustrated in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_2\" type=\"figure\">1</ref>. It is clear that a doctor is much better positioned to make a decision with the help of a model if intelligible explanations are provided. In this case, an explanation is a small list of symptoms with relative weightssymptoms that either contribute to the prediction (in green) or are evidence against it (in red). Humans usually have prior knowledge about the application domain, which they can use to accept (trust) or reject a prediction if they understand the reasoning behind it. It has been observed, for example, that providing explanations can increase the acceptance of movie recommendations <ref target=\"#b11\" type=\"bibr\">[12]</ref> and other automated systems <ref target=\"#b7\" type=\"bibr\">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Every machine learning application also requires a certain measure of overall trust in the model. Development and evaluation of a classification model often consists of collecting annotated data, of which a held-out subset is used for automated evaluation. Although this is a useful pipeline for many applications, evaluation on validation data may not correspond to performance \"in the wild\", as practitioners often overestimate the accuracy of their models <ref target=\"#b19\" type=\"bibr\">[20]</ref>, and thus trust cannot rely solely on it. Looking at examples offers an alternative method to assess truth in the model, especially if the examples are explained. We thus propose explaining several representative individual predictions of a model as a way to provide a global understanding.</p><p>There are several ways a model or its evaluation can go wrong. Data leakage, for example, defined as the unintentional leakage of signal into the training (and validation) data that would not appear when deployed <ref target=\"#b13\" type=\"bibr\">[14]</ref>, potentially increases accuracy. A challenging example cited by Kaufman et al. <ref target=\"#b13\" type=\"bibr\">[14]</ref> is one where the patient ID was found to be heavily correlated with the target class in the training and validation data. This issue would be incredibly challenging to identify just by observing the predictions and the raw data, but much easier if explanations such as the one in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_2\" type=\"figure\">1</ref> are provided, as patient ID would be listed as an explanation for predictions. Another particularly hard to detect problem is dataset shift <ref target=\"#b4\" type=\"bibr\">[5]</ref>, where training data is different than test data (we give an example in the famous 20 newsgroups dataset later on). The insights given by explanations are particularly helpful in identifying what must be done to convert an untrustworthy model into a trustworthy one -for example, removing leaked data or changing the training data to avoid dataset shift.</p><p>Machine learning practitioners often have to select a model from a number of alternatives, requiring them to assess the relative trust between two or more models. In Figure <ref type=\"figure\">Figure 2</ref>: Explaining individual predictions of competing classifiers trying to determine if a document is about \"Christianity\" or \"Atheism\".

Color indicates which class the word contributes to (green for \"Christianity\", magenta for \"Atheism\").</p><p>2, we show how individual prediction explanations can be used to select between models, in conjunction with accuracy. In this case, the algorithm with higher accuracy on the validation set is actually much worse, a fact that is easy to see when explanations are provided (again, due to human prior knowledge), but hard otherwise. Further, there is frequently a mismatch between the metrics that we can compute and optimize (e.g. accuracy) and the actual metrics of interest such as user engagement and retention. While we may not be able to measure such metrics, we have knowledge about how certain model behaviors can influence them. Therefore, a practitioner may wish to choose a less accurate model for content recommendation that does not place high importance in features related to \"clickbait\" articles (which may hurt user retention), even if exploiting such features increases the accuracy of the model in cross validation. We note that explanations are particularly useful in these (and other) scenarios if a method can produce them for any model, so that a variety of models can be compared.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Desired Characteristics for Explainers</head><p>We now outline a number of desired characteristics from explanation methods.</p><p>An essential criterion for explanations is that they must be interpretable, i.e., provide qualitative understanding between the input variables and the response. We note that interpretability must take into account the user's limitations. Thus, a linear model <ref target=\"#b23\" type=\"bibr\">[24]</ref>, a gradient vector <ref target=\"#b1\" type=\"bibr\">[2]</ref> or an additive model <ref target=\"#b5\" type=\"bibr\">[6]</ref> may or may not be interpretable. For example, if hundreds or thousands of features significantly contribute to a prediction, it is not reasonable to expect any user to comprehend why the prediction was made, even if individual weights can be inspected. This requirement further implies that explanations should be easy to understand, which is not necessarily true of the features used by the model, and thus the \"input variables\" in the explanations may need to be different than the features. Finally, we note that the notion of interpretability also depends on the target audience. Machine learning practitioners may be able to interpret small Bayesian networks, but laymen may be more comfortable with a small number of weighted features as an explanation.</p><p>Another essential criterion is local fidelity. Although it is often impossible for an explanation to be completely faithful unless it is the complete description of the model itself, for an explanation to be meaningful it must at least be locally faithful, i.e. it must correspond to how the model behaves in the vicinity of the instance being predicted. We note that local fidelity does not imply global fidelity: features that are globally important may not be important in the local context, and vice versa. While global fidelity would imply local fidelity, identifying globally faithful explanations that are interpretable remains a challenge for complex models.</p><p>While there are models that are inherently interpretable <ref target=\"#b5\" type=\"bibr\">[6,</ref><ref target=\"#b16\" type=\"bibr\">17,</ref><ref target=\"#b25\" type=\"bibr\">26,</ref><ref target=\"#b26\" type=\"bibr\">27]</ref>, an explainer should be able to explain any model, and thus be model-agnostic (i.e. treat the original model as a black box). Apart from the fact that many state-ofthe-art classifiers are not currently interpretable, this also provides flexibility to explain future classifiers.</p><p>In addition to explaining predictions, providing a global perspective is important to ascertain trust in the model. As mentioned before, accuracy may often not be a suitable metric to evaluate the model, and thus we want to explain the model. Building upon the explanations for individual predictions, we select a few explanations to present to the user, such that they are representative of the model.</p></div>\n",

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.1\">Interpretable Data Representations</head><p>Before we present the explanation system, it is important to distinguish between features and interpretable data representations. As mentioned before, interpretable explanations need to use a representation that is understandable to humans, regardless of the actual features used by the model. For example, a possible interpretable representation for text classification is a binary vector indicating the presence or absence of a word, even though the classifier may use more complex (and incomprehensible) features such as word embeddings. Likewise for image classification, an interpretable representation may be a binary vector indicating the \"presence\" or \"absence\" of a contiguous patch of similar pixels (a super-pixel), while the classifier may represent the image as a tensor with three color channels per pixel. We denote x ∈ R d be the original representation of an instance being explained, and we use x ∈ {0, 1} d to denote a binary vector for its interpretable representation.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.2\">Fidelity-Interpretability Trade-off</head><p>Formally, we define an explanation as a model g ∈ G, where G is a class of potentially interpretable models, such as linear models, decision trees, or falling rule lists <ref target=\"#b26\" type=\"bibr\">[27]</ref>, i.e. a model g ∈ G can be readily presented to the user with visual or textual artifacts. The domain of g is {0, 1} d , i.e. g acts over absence/presence of the interpretable components. As not every g ∈ G may be simple enough to be interpretablethus we let Ω(g) be a measure of complexity (as opposed to interpretability) of the explanation g ∈ G. For example, for decision trees Ω(g) may be the depth of the tree, while for linear models, Ω(g) may be the number of non-zero weights.</p><p>Let the model being explained be denoted f : R d → R. In classification, f (x) is the probability (or a binary indicator) that x belongs to a certain class 1 . We further use πx(z) as a proximity measure between an instance z to x, so as to define locality around x. Finally, let L(f, g, πx) be a measure of how unfaithful g is in approximating f in the locality defined by πx. In order to ensure both interpretability and local fidelity, we must minimize L(f, g, πx) while having Ω(g) be low enough to be interpretable by humans. The explanation produced by LIME is obtained by the following:</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_0\">ξ(x) = argmin g∈G L(f, g, πx) + Ω(g) (1)</formula><p>This formulation can be used with different explanation families G, fidelity functions L, and complexity measures Ω.</p><p>Here we focus on sparse linear models as explanations, and on performing the search using perturbations.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.3\">Sampling for Local Exploration</head><p>We want to minimize the locality-aware loss L(f, g, πx) without making any assumptions about f , since we want the explainer to be model-agnostic. Thus, in order to learn the local behavior of f as the interpretable inputs vary, we approximate L(f, g, πx) by drawing samples, weighted by πx. We sample instances around x by drawing nonzero elements of x uniformly at random (where the number of such draws is also uniformly sampled). Given a perturbed sample z ∈ {0, 1} d (which contains a fraction of the nonzero elements of x ), we recover the sample in the original representation z ∈ R d and obtain f (z), which is used as a label for the explanation model. Given this dataset Z of perturbed samples with the associated labels, we optimize Eq. (1) to get an explanation ξ(x). The primary intuition behind LIME is presented in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_3\" type=\"figure\">3</ref>, where we sample instances both in the vicinity of x (which have a high weight due to πx) and far away from x (low weight from πx). Even though the original model may be too complex to explain globally, LIME presents an explanation that is locally faithful (linear in this case), where the locality is captured by πx. It is worth noting that our method is fairly robust to sampling noise since the samples are weighted by πx in Eq. <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">(1)</ref>. We now present a concrete instance of this general framework.</p></div>\n",

Potentially, K can be adapted to be as big as the user can handle, or we could have different values of K for different instances. In this paper we use a constant value for K, leaving the exploration of different values to future work. We use the same Ω for image classification, using \"super-pixels\" (computed using any standard algorithm) instead of words, such that the interpretable representation of an image is a binary vector where 1 indicates the original super-pixel and 0 indicates a grayed out super-pixel. This particular choice of Ω makes directly solving Eq. (1) intractable, but we approximate it by first selecting K features with Lasso (using the regularization path <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">[9]</ref>) and then learning the weights via least squares (a procedure we call K-LASSO in Algorithm 1). Since Algorithm 1 produces an explanation for an individual prediction, its complexity does not depend on the size of the dataset, but instead on time to compute f (x) and on the number of samples N . In practice, explaining random forests with 1000 trees using scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org) on a laptop with N = 5000 takes under 3 seconds without any optimizations such as using gpus or parallelization. Explaining each prediction of the Inception network <ref target=\"#b24\" type=\"bibr\">[25]</ref> for image classification takes around 10 minutes.</p><p>Any choice of interpretable representations and G will have some inherent drawbacks. First, while the underlying model can be treated as a black-box, certain interpretable representations will not be powerful enough to explain certain behaviors. For example, a model that predicts sepia-toned images to be retro cannot be explained by presence of absence of super pixels. Second, our choice of G (sparse linear models) means that if the underlying model is highly non-linear even in the locality of the prediction, there may not be a faithful explanation. However, we can estimate the faithfulness of Algorithm 1 Sparse Linear Explanations using LIME Require: Classifier f , Number of samples N Require: Instance x, and its interpretable version x Require: Similarity kernel πx, Length of explanation K</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_2\">Z ← {} for i ∈ {1, 2, 3, ..., N } do z i ← sample around(x ) Z ← Z ∪ z i , f (zi), πx(zi) end for w ← K-Lasso(Z, K)</formula><p>with z i as features, f (z) as target return w the explanation on Z, and present this information to the user. This estimate of faithfulness can also be used for selecting an appropriate family of explanations from a set of multiple interpretable model classes, thus adapting to the given dataset and the classifier. We leave such exploration for future work, as linear explanations work quite well for multiple black-box models in our experiments.</p></div>\n",

The word \"Posting\" appears in 22% of examples in the training set, 99% of them in the class \"Atheism\".

We explain the prediction of Google's pre-trained Inception neural network <ref target=\"#b24\" type=\"bibr\">[25]</ref> in this fashion on an arbitrary image (Figure <ref target=\"#fig_4\" type=\"figure\">4a</ref>).

We propose to give a global understanding of the model by explaining a set of individual instances. This approach is still model agnostic, and is complementary to computing summary statistics such as held-out accuracy.</p><p>Even though explanations of multiple instances can be insightful, these instances need to be selected judiciously, since users may not have the time to examine a large number of explanations. We represent the time/patience that humans have by a budget B that denotes the number of explanations they are willing to look at in order to understand a model. Given a set of instances X, we define the pick step as the task of selecting B instances for the user to inspect.</p><p>The pick step is not dependent on the existence of explanations -one of the main purpose of tools like Modeltracker <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">[1]</ref> and others <ref target=\"#b10\" type=\"bibr\">[11]</ref> is to assist users in selecting instances themselves, and examining the raw data and predictions. However, since looking at raw data is not enough to understand predictions and get insights, the pick step should take into account the explanations that accompany each prediction. Moreover, this method should pick a diverse, representative set of explanations to show the user -i.e. non-redundant explanations that represent how the model behaves globally.</p><p>Given the explanations for a set of instances X (|X| = n), we construct an n × d explanation matrix W that represents the local importance of the interpretable components for each instance. When using linear models as explanations, for an instance xi and explanation gi = ξ(xi), we set Wij = |wg ij |. Further, for each component (column) j in W, we let Ij denote the global importance of that component in the explanation space. Intuitively, we want I such that features that explain many different instances have higher importance scores. In Figure <ref target=\"#fig_6\" type=\"figure\">5</ref>, we show a toy example W, with n = d = 5, where W is binary (for simplicity). The importance function I should score feature f2 higher than feature f1, i.e. I2 &gt; I1, since feature f2 is used to explain more instances. Concretely for the text applications, we set Ij = n i=1 Wij. For images, I must measure something that is comparable across the super-pixels in different images,  Algorithm 2 Submodular pick (SP) algorithm Require:</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_3\">Instances X, Budget B for all xi ∈ X do Wi ← explain(xi, x i ) Using Algorithm 1 end for for j ∈ {1 . . . d } do Ij ← n i=1 |Wij| Compute feature importances end for V ← {} while |V | &lt; B do</formula><p>Greedy optimization of Eq (4</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_4\">) V ← V ∪ argmax i c(V ∪ {i}, W, I) end while return V</formula><p>such as color histograms or other features of super-pixels; we leave further exploration of these ideas for future work.</p><p>While we want to pick instances that cover the important components, the set of explanations must not be redundant in the components they show the users, i.e. avoid selecting instances with similar explanations. In Figure <ref target=\"#fig_6\" type=\"figure\">5</ref>, after the second row is picked, the third row adds no value, as the user has already seen features f2 and f3 -while the last row exposes the user to completely new features. Selecting the second and last row results in the coverage of almost all the features. We formalize this non-redundant coverage intuition in Eq.

For parzen, we take the K features with the highest absolute gradients as explanations. We set the hyper-parameters for parzen and LIME using cross validation, and set N = 15, 000. We also compare against a greedy procedure (similar to Martens and Provost <ref target=\"#b17\" type=\"bibr\">[18]</ref>) in which we greedily remove features that contribute the most to the predicted class until the prediction changes (or we reach the maximum of K features), and a random procedure that randomly picks K features as an explanation.

In particular, we train both classifiers such that the maximum number of features they use for any instance is 10, and thus we know the gold set of features that the are considered important by these models. For each prediction on the test set, we generate explanations and compute the fraction of these gold features that are recovered by the explanations. We report this recall averaged over all the test instances in Figures <ref target=\"#fig_8\" type=\"figure\">6 and 7</ref>. We observe that the greedy approach is comparable to parzen on logistic regression, but is substantially worse on decision trees since changing a single feature at a time often does not have an effect on the prediction. The overall recall by parzen is low, likely due to the difficulty in approximating the original highdimensional classifier.

We thus develop oracle \"trustworthiness\" by labeling test set predictions from a black box classifier as \"untrustworthy\" if the prediction changes when untrustworthy features are removed from the instance, and \"trustworthy\" otherwise. In order to simulate users, we assume that users deem predictions untrustworthy from LIME and parzen explanations if the prediction from the linear approximation changes when all untrustworthy features that appear in the explanations are removed (the simulated human \"discounts\" the effect of untrustworthy features). For greedy and random, the prediction is mistrusted if any untrustworthy features are present in the explanation, since these methods do not provide a notion of the contribution of each feature to the prediction. Thus for each test set prediction, we can evaluate whether the simulated user trusts it using each explanation method, and compare it to the trustworthiness oracle.</p><p>Using this setup, we report the F1 on the trustworthy   predictions for each explanation method, averaged over 100 runs, in Table <ref target=\"#tab_0\" type=\"table\">1</ref>. The results indicate that LIME dominates others (all results are significant at p = 0.01) on both datasets, and for all of the black box models. The other methods either achieve a lower recall (i.e. they mistrust predictions more than they should) or lower precision (i.e. they trust too many predictions), while LIME maintains both high precision and high recall. Even though we artificially select which features are untrustworthy, these results indicate that LIME is helpful in assessing trust in individual predictions.</p></div>\n",

For this purpose, we add 10 artificially \"noisy\" features. Specifically, on training and validation sets (80/20 split of the original training data), each artificial feature appears in 10% of the examples in one class, and 20% of the other, while on the test instances, each artificial feature appears in 10% of the examples in each class. This recreates the situation where the models use not only features that are informative in the real world, but also ones that introduce spurious correlations. We create pairs of competing classifiers by repeatedly training pairs of random forests with 30 trees until their validation accuracy is within 0.1% of each other, but their test accuracy differs by at least 5%. Thus, it is not possible to identify the better classifier (the one with higher test accuracy) from the accuracy on the validation data.</p><p>The goal of this experiment is to evaluate whether a user can identify the better classifier based on the explanations of B instances from the validation set. The simulated human marks the set of artificial features that appear in the B explanations as untrustworthy, following which we evaluate how many total predictions in the validation set should be trusted (as in the previous section, treating only marked features as untrustworthy). Then, we select the classifier with fewer untrustworthy predictions, and compare this choice to the classifier with higher held-out test set accuracy.</p><p>We present the accuracy of picking the correct classifier as B varies, averaged over 800 runs, in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_11\" type=\"figure\">8</ref>. We omit SP-parzen and RP-parzen from the figure since they did not produce useful explanations, performing only slightly better than random. LIME is consistently better than greedy, irrespective of the pick method. Further, combining submodular pick with LIME outperforms all other methods, in particular it is much better than RP-LIME when only a few examples are shown to the users.

We restrict both the number of words in each explanation (K) and the number of documents that each person inspects (B) to 6. The position of each algorithm and the order of the instances seen are randomized between subjects. After examining the explanations, users are asked to select which algorithm will perform best in the real world. The explanations are produced by either greedy (chosen as a baseline due to its performance in the simulated user experiment) or LIME, and the instances are selected either by random (RP) or submodular pick (SP). We modify the greedy step in Algorithm 2 slightly so it alternates between explanations of the two classifiers. For each setting, we repeat the experiment with 100 users.

Explanations can aid in this process by presenting the important features, particularly for removing features that the users feel do not generalize.</p><p>We use the 20 newsgroups data here as well, and ask Amazon Mechanical Turk users to identify which words from the explanations should be removed from subsequent training, for the worse classifier from the previous section ( §6.2). In each round, the subject marks words for deletion after observing B = 10 instances with K = 10 words in each explanation (an interface similar to Figure <ref type=\"figure\">2</ref>, but with a single algorithm). As a reminder, the users here are not experts in machine learning and are unfamiliar with feature engineering, thus are only identifying words based on their semantic content. Further, users do not have any access to the religion dataset -they do not even know of its existence. We start the experiment with 10 subjects. After they mark words for deletion, we train 10 different classifiers, one for each subject (with the corresponding words removed). The explanations for each classifier are then presented to a set of 5 users in a new round of interaction, which results in 50 new classifiers. We do a final round, after which we have 250 classifiers, each with a path of interaction tracing back to the first 10 subjects.</p><p>The explanations and instances shown to each user are produced by SP-LIME or RP-LIME. We show the average accuracy on the religion dataset at each interaction round for the paths originating from each of the original 10 subjects (shaded lines), and the average across all paths (solid lines) in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_2\" type=\"figure\">10</ref>. It is clear from the figure that the crowd workers are able to improve the model by removing features they deem unimportant for the task. Further, SP-LIME outperforms RP-LIME, indicating selection of the instances to show the users is crucial for efficient feature engineering.</p><p>Each subject took an average of 3.6 minutes per round of cleaning, resulting in just under 11 minutes to produce a classifier that generalizes much better to real world data. Each path had on average 200 words removed with SP, and 157 with RP, indicating that incorporating coverage of important features is useful for feature engineering. Further, out of an average of 200 words selected with SP, 174 were selected by at least half of the users, while 68 by all the users. Along with the fact that the variance in the accuracy decreases across rounds, this high agreement demonstrates that the users are converging to similar correct models. This evaluation is an example of how explanations make it easy to improve an untrustworthy classifier -in this case easy enough that machine learning knowledge is not required.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"6.4\">Do explanations lead to insights?</head><p>Often artifacts of data collection can induce undesirable correlations that the classifiers pick up during training. These issues can be very difficult to identify just by looking at the raw data and predictions. In an effort to reproduce such a setting, we take the task of distinguishing between photos of Wolves and Eskimo Dogs (huskies). We train a logistic regression classifier on a training set of 20 images, hand selected such that all pictures of wolves had snow in the background, while pictures of huskies did not. As the features for the images, we use the first max-pooling layer of Google's pre-trained Inception neural network <ref target=\"#b24\" type=\"bibr\">[25]</ref>. On a collection of additional 60 images, the classifier predicts \"Wolf\" if there is snow (or light background at the bottom), and \"Husky\" otherwise, regardless of animal color, position, pose, etc. We trained this bad classifier intentionally, to evaluate whether subjects are able to detect it.</p><p>The experiment proceeds as follows: we first present a balanced set of 10 test predictions (without explanations), where one wolf is not in a snowy background (and thus the prediction is \"Husky\") and one husky is (and is thus predicted as \"Wolf\"). We show the \"Husky\" mistake in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_2\" type=\"figure\">11a</ref>. The other 8 examples are classified correctly. We then ask the subject three questions: (1) Do they trust this algorithm   to work well in the real world, (2) why, and (3) how do they think the algorithm is able to distinguish between these photos of wolves and huskies. After getting these responses, we show the same images with the associated explanations, such as in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_2\" type=\"figure\">11b</ref>, and ask the same questions.</p><p>Since this task requires some familiarity with the notion of spurious correlations and generalization, the set of subjects for this experiment were graduate students who have taken at least one graduate machine learning course. After gathering the responses, we had 3 independent evaluators read their reasoning and determine if each subject mentioned snow, background, or equivalent as a feature the model may be using. We pick the majority to decide whether the subject was correct about the insight, and report these numbers before and after showing the explanations in Table <ref target=\"#tab_1\" type=\"table\">2</ref>.</p><p>Before observing the explanations, more than a third trusted the classifier, and a little less than half mentioned the snow pattern as something the neural network was using -although all speculated on other patterns. After examining the explanations, however, almost all of the subjects identified the correct insight, with much more certainty that it was a determining factor. Further, the trust in the classifier also dropped substantially. Although our sample size is small, this experiment demonstrates the utility of explaining individual predictions for getting insights into classifiers knowing when not to trust them and why.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"7.\">RELATED WORK</head><p>The problems with relying on validation set accuracy as the primary measure of trust have been well studied. Practitioners consistently overestimate their model's accuracy <ref target=\"#b19\" type=\"bibr\">[20]</ref>, propagate feedback loops <ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">[23]</ref>, or fail to notice data leaks <ref target=\"#b13\" type=\"bibr\">[14]</ref>. In order to address these issues, researchers have proposed tools like Gestalt <ref target=\"#b20\" type=\"bibr\">[21]</ref> and Modeltracker <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">[1]</ref>, which help users navigate individual instances. These tools are complementary to LIME in terms of explaining models, since they do not address the problem of explaining individual predictions. Further, our submodular pick procedure can be incorporated in such tools to aid users in navigating larger datasets. Some recent work aims to anticipate failures in machine learning, specifically for vision tasks <ref target=\"#b2\" type=\"bibr\">[3,</ref><ref target=\"#b28\" type=\"bibr\">29]</ref>. Letting users know when the systems are likely to fail can lead to an increase in trust, by avoiding \"silly mistakes\" <ref target=\"#b7\" type=\"bibr\">[8]</ref>. These solutions either require additional annotations and feature engineering that is specific to vision tasks or do not provide insight into why a decision should not be trusted. Furthermore, they assume that the current evaluation metrics are reliable, which may not be the case if problems such as data leakage are present. Other recent work <ref target=\"#b10\" type=\"bibr\">[11]</ref> focuses on exposing users to different kinds of mistakes (our pick step). Interestingly, the subjects in their study did not notice the serious problems in the 20 newsgroups data even after looking at many mistakes, suggesting that examining raw data is not sufficient. Note that Groce et al. <ref target=\"#b10\" type=\"bibr\">[11]</ref> are not alone in this regard, many researchers in the field have unwittingly published classifiers that would not generalize for this task.</p><p>Using LIME, we show that even non-experts are able to identify these irregularities when explanations are present. Further, LIME can complement these existing systems, and allow users to assess trust even when a prediction seems \"correct\" but is made for the wrong reasons.</p><p>Recognizing the utility of explanations in assessing trust, many have proposed using interpretable models <ref target=\"#b26\" type=\"bibr\">[27]</ref>, especially for the medical domain <ref target=\"#b5\" type=\"bibr\">[6,</ref><ref target=\"#b16\" type=\"bibr\">17,</ref><ref target=\"#b25\" type=\"bibr\">26]</ref>. While such models may be appropriate for some domains, they may not apply equally well to others (e.g. a supersparse linear model <ref target=\"#b25\" type=\"bibr\">[26]</ref> with 5 − 10 features is unsuitable for text applications). Interpretability, in these cases, comes at the cost of flexibility, accuracy, or efficiency. For text, EluciDebug <ref target=\"#b15\" type=\"bibr\">[16]</ref> is a full human-in-the-loop system that shares many of our goals (interpretability, faithfulness, etc). However, they focus on an already interpretable model (Naive Bayes). In computer vision, systems that rely on object detection to produce candidate alignments <ref target=\"#b12\" type=\"bibr\">[13]</ref> or attention <ref target=\"#b27\" type=\"bibr\">[28]</ref> are able to produce explanations for their predictions. These are, however, constrained to specific neural network architectures or incapable of detecting \"non object\" parts of the images. Here we focus on general, model-agnostic explanations that can be applied to any classifier or regressor that is appropriate for the domain -even ones that are yet to be proposed.</p><p>A common approach to model-agnostic explanation is learning a potentially interpretable model on the predictions of the original model <ref target=\"#b1\" type=\"bibr\">[2,</ref><ref target=\"#b6\" type=\"bibr\">7,</ref><ref target=\"#b21\" type=\"bibr\">22]</ref>. Having the explanation be a gradient vector <ref target=\"#b1\" type=\"bibr\">[2]</ref> captures a similar locality intuition to that of LIME. However, interpreting the coefficients on the gradient is difficult, particularly for confident predictions (where gradient is near zero). Further, these explanations approximate the original model globally, thus maintaining local fidelity becomes a significant challenge, as our experiments demonstrate. In contrast, LIME solves the much more feasible task of finding a model that approximates the original model locally. The idea of perturbing inputs for explanations has been explored before <ref target=\"#b23\" type=\"bibr\">[24]</ref>, where the authors focus on learning a specific contribution model, as opposed to our general framework. None of these approaches explicitly take cognitive limitations into account, and thus may produce non-interpretable explanations, such as a gradients or linear models with thousands of non-zero weights. The problem becomes worse if the original features are nonsensical to humans (e.g. word embeddings). In contrast, LIME incorporates interpretability both in the optimization and in our notion of interpretable representation, such that domain and task specific interpretability criteria can be accommodated.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"8.\">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we argued that trust is crucial for effective human interaction with machine learning systems, and that explaining individual predictions is important in assessing trust. We proposed LIME, a modular and extensible approach to faithfully explain the predictions of any model in an interpretable manner. We also introduced SP-LIME, a method to select representative and non-redundant predictions, providing a global view of the model to users. Our experiments demonstrated that explanations are useful for a variety of models in trust-related tasks in the text and image domains, with both expert and non-expert users: deciding between models, assessing trust, improving untrustworthy models, and getting insights into predictions.</p><p>There are a number of avenues of future work that we would like to explore. Although we describe only sparse linear models as explanations, our framework supports the exploration of a variety of explanation families, such as decision trees; it would be interesting to see a comparative study on these with real users. One issue that we do not mention in this work was how to perform the pick step for images, and we would like to address this limitation in the future. The domain and model agnosticism enables us to explore a variety of applications, and we would like to investigate potential uses in speech, video, and medical domains, as well as recommendation systems. Finally, we would like to explore theoretical properties (such as the appropriate number of samples) and computational optimizations (such as using parallelization and GPU processing), in order to provide the accurate, real-time explanations that are critical for any human-in-the-loop machine learning system.</p></div><figure xml:id=\"fig_0\" xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head/><label/><figDesc>KDD 2016 San Francisco, CA, USA c 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"1\">Introduction</head><p>Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, the advent of AI technologies has marked a significant transformation, reshaping interactions and integrating deeply into various facets of daily life and industry <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">[1,</ref><ref target=\"#b1\" type=\"bibr\">2]</ref>. Building on this momentum, OpenAI released, in February 2024, Sora, a text-to-video generative AI model that can generate videos of realistic or imaginative scenes from text prompts. Compared to previous video generation models, Sora is distinguished by its ability to produce up to 1-minute long videos with high quality while maintaining adherence to user's text instructions <ref target=\"#b2\" type=\"bibr\">[3]</ref>. This progression of Sora is the embodiment of the long-standing AI research mission of equipping AI systems (or AI Agents) with the capability of understanding and interacting with the physical world in motion. This involves developing AI models that are capable of not only interpreting complex user instructions but also applying this understanding to solve real-world problems through dynamic and contextually rich simulations. Sora demonstrates a remarkable ability to accurately interpret and execute complex human instructions, as illustrated in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_0\" type=\"figure\">2</ref>. The model can generate detailed scenes that include multiple characters that perform specific actions against intricate backgrounds. Researchers attribute Sora's proficiency to not only processing user-generated textual prompts but also discerning the complicated interplay of elements within a scenario. One of the most striking aspects of Sora is its capacity for up to a minute-long video while maintaining high visual quality and compelling visual coherency. Unlike earlier models that can only generate short video clips, Sora's minute-long video creation possesses a sense of progression and a visually consistent journey from its first frame to the last. In addition, Sora's advancements are evident in its ability to produce extended video sequences with nuanced depictions of motion and interaction, overcoming the constraints of shorter clips and simpler visual renderings that characterized earlier video generation models. This capability represents a leap forward in AI-driven creative tools, allowing users to convert text narratives to rich visual stories. Overall, these advances show the potential of Sora as a world simulator to provide nuanced insights into the physical and contextual dynamics of the depicted scenes. <ref target=\"#b2\" type=\"bibr\">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Technology. At the heart of Sora is a pre-trained diffusion transformer <ref target=\"#b3\" type=\"bibr\">[4]</ref>. Transformer models have proven scalable and effective for many natural language tasks. Similar to powerful large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Sora can parse text and comprehend complex user instructions. To make video generation computationally efficient, Sora employs spacetime latent patches as its building blocks. Specifically, Sora compresses a raw input video into a latent spacetime representation. Then, a sequence of latent spacetime patches is extracted from the compressed video to encapsulate both the visual appearance and motion dynamics over brief intervals. These patches, analogous to word tokens in language models, provide Sora with detailed visual phrases to be used to construct videos. Sora's text-to-video generation is performed by a diffusion transformer model. Starting with a frame filled with visual noise, the model iteratively denoises the image and introduces specific details according to the provided text prompt. In essence, the generated video emerges through a multi-step refinement process, with each step refining the video to be more aligned with the desired content and quality.</p><p>Highlights of Sora. Sora's capabilities have profound implications in various aspects:</p><p>• Improving simulation abilities: Training Sora at scale is attributed to its remarkable ability to simulate various aspects of the physical world. Despite lacking explicit 3D modeling, Sora exhibits 3D consistency with dynamic camera motion and long-range coherence that includes object persistence and simulates simple interactions with the world. Moreover, Sora intriguingly simulates digital environments like Minecraft, controlled by a basic policy while maintaining visual fidelity. These emergent abilities suggest that scaling video models is effective in creating AI models to simulate the complexity of physical and digital worlds. • Boosting creativity: Imagine outlining a concept through text, whether a simple object or a full scene, and seeing a realistic or highly stylized video rendered within seconds. Sora allows an accelerated design process for faster exploration and refinement of ideas, thus significantly boosting the creativity of artists, filmmakers, and designers. • Driving educational innovations: Visual aids have long been integral to understanding important concepts in education. With Sora, educators can easily turn a class plan from text to videos to captivate students' attention and improve learning efficiency. From scientific simulations to historical dramatizations, the possibilities are boundless. • Enhancing Accessibility: Enhancing accessibility in the visual domain is paramount. Sora offers an innovative solution by converting textual descriptions to visual content. This capability empowers all individuals, including those with visual impairments, to actively engage in content creation and interact with others in more effective ways. Consequently, it allows for a more inclusive environment where everyone has the opportunity to express his or her ideas through videos. • Fostering emerging applications: The applications of Sora are vast. For example, marketers might use it to create dynamic advertisements tailored to specific audience descriptions. Game developers might use it to generate customized visuals or even character actions from player narratives.</p><p>Limitations and Opportunities. While Sora's achievements highlight significant advancements in AI, challenges remain. Depicting complex actions or capturing subtle facial expressions are among the areas where the model could be enhanced. In addition, ethical considerations such as mitigating biases in generated content and preventing harmful visual outputs underscore the importance of responsible usage by developers, researchers, and the broader community. Ensuring that Sora's outputs are consistently safe and unbiased is a principal challenge. The field of video generation is advancing swiftly, with academic and industry research teams making relentless strides. The advent of competing text-to-video models suggests that Sora may soon be part of a dynamic ecosystem.

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"2.1\">History</head><p>In the realm of computer vision (CV), prior to the deep learning revolution, traditional image generation techniques relied on methods like texture synthesis <ref target=\"#b4\" type=\"bibr\">[5]</ref> and texture mapping <ref target=\"#b5\" type=\"bibr\">[6]</ref>, based on hand-crafted features. However, these methods were limited in their capacity to produce complex and vivid images. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <ref target=\"#b6\" type=\"bibr\">[7]</ref> and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) <ref target=\"#b7\" type=\"bibr\">[8]</ref> marked a significant turning point due to its remarkable capabilities across various applications. Subsequent developments, such as flow models <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">[9]</ref> and diffusion models <ref target=\"#b9\" type=\"bibr\">[10]</ref>, further enhanced image generation with greater detail and quality. The recent progress in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technologies has democratized content creation, enabling users to generate desired content through simple textual instructions <ref target=\"#b10\" type=\"bibr\">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Over the past decade, the development of generative CV models has taken various routes, as shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_1\" type=\"figure\">3</ref>. This landscape began to shift notably following the successful application of the transformer architecture <ref target=\"#b11\" type=\"bibr\">[12]</ref> in NLP, as demonstrated by BERT <ref target=\"#b12\" type=\"bibr\">[13]</ref> and GPT <ref target=\"#b13\" type=\"bibr\">[14]</ref>. In CV, researchers take this concept even further by combining the transformer architecture with visual components, allowing it to be applied to downstream CV tasks, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) <ref target=\"#b14\" type=\"bibr\">[15]</ref> and Swin Transformer <ref target=\"#b15\" type=\"bibr\">[16]</ref>. Parallel to the transformer's success, diffusion models have also made significant strides in the fields of image and video generation <ref target=\"#b9\" type=\"bibr\">[10]</ref>. Diffusion models offer a mathematically sound framework for converting noise into images with U-Nets <ref target=\"#b16\" type=\"bibr\">[17]</ref>, where U-Nets facilitate this process by learning to predict and mitigate noise at each step. Since 2021, a paramount focus in AI has been on generative language and vision models that are capable of interpreting human instructions, known as multimodal models. For example, CLIP <ref target=\"#b17\" type=\"bibr\">[18]</ref> is a pioneering vision-language model that combines transformer architecture with visual elements, facilitating its training on vast datasets of text and images. By integrating visual and linguistic knowledge from the outset, CLIP can function as an image encoder within multimodal generation frameworks. Another notable example is Stable Diffusion <ref target=\"#b18\" type=\"bibr\">[19]</ref>, a versatile text-to-image AI model celebrated for its adaptability and ease of use. It employs transformer architecture and latent diffusion techniques to decode textual inputs and produce images of a wide array of styles, further illustrating the advancements in multimodal AI.</p><p>Following the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, we have witnessed the emergence of commercial text-to-image products in 2023, such as Stable Diffusion <ref target=\"#b18\" type=\"bibr\">[19]</ref>, Midjourney <ref target=\"#b19\" type=\"bibr\">[20]</ref>, DALL-E 3 <ref target=\"#b20\" type=\"bibr\">[21]</ref>. These tools enable users to generate new images of high resolution and quality with simple text prompts, showcasing the potential of AI in creative image generation. However, transitioning from text-to-image to text-to-video is challenging due to the temporal complexity of videos. Despite numerous efforts in industry and academia, most existing video generation tools, such as Pika <ref target=\"#b21\" type=\"bibr\">[22]</ref> and Gen-2 <ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">[23]</ref>, are limited to producing only short video clips of a few seconds. In this context, Sora represents a significant breakthrough, akin to ChatGPT's impact in the NLP domain. Sora is the first model that is capable of generating videos up to one minute long based on human instructions, marking a milestone that profoundly influences research and development in generative AI. To facilitate easy access to the latest advancements in vision generation models, the most recent works have been compiled and provided in the Appendix and our GitHub.</p></div>\n",

With scaling laws for LLMs, it is natural to ask whether the development of vision models follows similar scaling laws. Recently, Zhai et al. <ref target=\"#b23\" type=\"bibr\">[24]</ref> have demonstrated that the performance-compute frontier for ViT models with enough training data roughly follows a (saturating) power law. Following them, Google Research <ref target=\"#b24\" type=\"bibr\">[25]</ref> presented a recipe for highly efficient and stable training of a 22B-parameter ViT. Results show that great performance can be achieved using the frozen model to produce embeddings, and then training thin layers on top. Sora, as a large vision model (LVM), aligns with these scaling principles, uncovering several emergent abilities in text-to-video generation. This significant progression underscores the potential for LVMs to achieve advancements like those seen in LLMs.</p><p>Emergent Abilities. Emergent abilities in LLMs are sophisticated behaviors or functions that manifest at certain scales-often linked to the size of the model's parameters-that were not explicitly programmed or anticipated by their developers. These abilities are termed \"emergent\" because they emerge from the model's comprehensive training across varied datasets, coupled with its extensive parameter count. This combination enables the model to form connections and draw inferences that surpass mere pattern recognition or rote memorization. Typically, the emergence of these abilities cannot be straightforwardly predicted by extrapolating from the performance of smaller-scale models. While numerous LLMs, such as Chat-GPT and GPT-4, exhibit emergent abilities, vision models demonstrating comparable capabilities have been scarce until the advent of Sora. According to Sora's technical report, it is the first vision model to exhibit confirmed emergent abilities, marking a significant milestone in the field of computer vision.</p><p>In addition to its emergent abilities, Sora exhibits other notable capabilities, including instruction following, visual prompt engineering, and video understanding. These aspects of Sora's functionality represent significant advancements in the vision domain and will be explored and discussed in the rest sections.</p></div>\n",

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.1\">Overview of Sora</head><p>In the core essence, Sora is a diffusion transformer <ref target=\"#b3\" type=\"bibr\">[4]</ref> with flexible sampling dimensions as shown in Figure <ref type=\"figure\">4</ref>. It has three parts: (1) A time-space compressor first maps the original video into latent space.</p><p>(2) A ViT then processes the tokenized latent representation and outputs the denoised latent representation.</p><p>(3) A CLIP-like <ref target=\"#b25\" type=\"bibr\">[26]</ref> conditioning mechanism receives LLM-augmented user instructions and potentially visual prompts to guide the diffusion model to generate styled or themed videos. After many denoising Figure <ref type=\"figure\">4</ref>: Reverse Engineering: Overview of Sora framework steps, the latent representation of the generated video is obtained and then mapped back to pixel space with the corresponding decoder. In this section, we aim to reverse engineer the technology used by Sora and discuss a wide range of related works.</p><p>3.2 Data Pre-processing 3.2.1 Variable Durations, Resolutions, Aspect Ratios One distinguishing feature of Sora is its ability to train on, understand, and generate videos and images at their native sizes <ref target=\"#b2\" type=\"bibr\">[3]</ref> as illustrated in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_2\" type=\"figure\">5</ref>. Traditional methods often resize, crop, or adjust the aspect ratios of videos to fit a uniform standard-typically short clips with square frames at fixed low resolutions <ref target=\"#b26\" type=\"bibr\">[27]</ref>[28] <ref target=\"#b28\" type=\"bibr\">[29]</ref>. Those samples are often generated at a wider temporal stride and rely on separately trained frame-insertion and resolution-rendering models as the final step, creating inconsistency across the video. Utilizing the diffusion transformer architecture <ref target=\"#b3\" type=\"bibr\">[4]</ref> (see Section 3.2.4), Sora is the first model to embrace the diversity of visual data and can sample in a wide array of video and image formats, ranging from widescreen 1920x1080p videos to vertical 1080x1920p videos and everything in between without compromising their original dimensions.  Training on data in their native sizes significantly improves composition and framing in the generated videos. Empirical findings suggest that by maintaining the original aspect ratios, Sora achieves a more natural and coherent visual narrative. The comparison between Sora and a model trained on uniformly cropped square videos demonstrates a clear advantage as shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_3\" type=\"figure\">6</ref>. Videos produced by Sora exhibit better framing, ensuring subjects are fully captured in the scene, as opposed to the sometimes truncated views resulting from square cropping. This nuanced understanding and preservation of original video and image characteristics mark a significant advancement in the field of generative models. Sora's approach not only showcases the potential for more authentic and engaging video generation but also highlights the importance of diversity in training data for achieving high-quality results in generative AI. The training approach of Sora aligns with the core tenet of Richard Sutton's THE BITTER LESSON <ref target=\"#b29\" type=\"bibr\">[30]</ref>, which states that leveraging computation over human-designed features leads to more effective and flexible AI systems. Just as the original design of diffusion transformers seeks simplicity and scalability <ref target=\"#b30\" type=\"bibr\">[31]</ref>, Sora's strategy of training on data at their native sizes eschews traditional AI reliance on human-derived abstractions, favoring instead a generalist method that scales with computational power. In the rest of this section, we try to reverse engineer the architecture design of Sora and discuss related technologies to achieve this amazing feature.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.2.2\">Unified Visual Representation</head><p>To effectively process diverse visual inputs including images and videos with varying durations, resolutions, and aspect ratios, a crucial approach involves transforming all forms of visual data into a unified representation, which facilitates the large-scale training of generative models. Specifically, Sora patchifies videos by initially compressing videos into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by decomposing the representation into spacetime patches. However, Sora's technical report <ref target=\"#b2\" type=\"bibr\">[3]</ref> merely presents a high-level idea, making reproduction challenging for the research community. In this section, we try to reverse-engineer the potential ingredients and technical pathways. Additionally, we will discuss viable alternatives that could replicate Sora's functionalities, drawing upon insights from existing literature. Figure <ref type=\"figure\">7</ref>: At a high level, Sora turns videos into patches by first compressing videos into a lowerdimensional latent space, and subsequently decomposing the representation into spacetime patches. Source: Sora's technical report <ref target=\"#b2\" type=\"bibr\">[3]</ref>. Sora's video compression network (or visual encoder) aims to reduce the dimensionality of input data, especially a raw video, and output a latent representation that is compressed both temporally and spatially as shown in Figure <ref type=\"figure\">7</ref>. According to the references in the technical report, the compression network is built upon VAE or Vector Quantised-VAE (VQ-VAE) <ref target=\"#b31\" type=\"bibr\">[32]</ref>. However, it is challenging for VAE to map visual data of any size to a unified and fixed-sized latent space if resizing and cropping are not used as mentioned in the technical report. We summarize two distinct implementations to address this issue: Spatial-patch Compression. This involves transforming video frames into fixed-size patches, akin to the methodologies employed in ViT <ref target=\"#b14\" type=\"bibr\">[15]</ref> and MAE <ref target=\"#b32\" type=\"bibr\">[33]</ref> (see Figure <ref target=\"#fig_4\" type=\"figure\">8</ref>), before encoding them into a latent space. This approach is particularly effective for accommodating videos of varying resolutions and aspect ratios, as it encodes entire frames through the processing of individual patches. Subsequently, these spatial tokens are organized in a temporal sequence to create a spatial-temporal latent representation. This technique highlights several critical considerations: Temporal dimension variability -given the varying durations of training videos, the temporal dimension of the latent space representation cannot be fixed. To address this, one can either sample a specific number of frames (padding or temporal interpolation <ref target=\"#b33\" type=\"bibr\">[34]</ref> may be needed for much shorter videos) or define a universally extended (super long) input length for subsequent processing (more details are described in Section 3.2.4); Utilization of pre-trained visual encoders -for processing videos of high resolution, leveraging existing pre-trained visual encoders, such as the VAE encoder from Stable Diffusion <ref target=\"#b18\" type=\"bibr\">[19]</ref>, is advisable for most researchers while Sora's team is expected to train their own compression network with a decoder (the video generator) from scratch via the manner employed in training latent diffusion models <ref target=\"#b18\" type=\"bibr\">[19,</ref><ref target=\"#b34\" type=\"bibr\">35,</ref><ref target=\"#b35\" type=\"bibr\">36]</ref>. These encoders can efficiently compress large-size patches (e.g., 256 × 256), facilitating the management of large-scale data; Temporal information aggregation -since this method primarily focuses on spatial patch compression, it necessitates an additional mechanism for aggregating temporal information within the model. This aspect is crucial for capturing dynamic changes over time and is further elaborated in subsequent sections (see details in Section 3.3.1 and Figure <ref target=\"#fig_11\" type=\"figure\">14</ref>).</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.2.3\">Video Compression Network</head></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Spatial-temporal-patch Compression.</head><p>This technique is designed to encapsulate both spatial and temporal dimensions of video data, offering a comprehensive representation. This technique extends beyond merely analyzing static frames by considering the movement and changes across frames, thereby capturing the video's dynamic aspects. The utilization of 3D convolution emerges as a straightforward and potent method for achieving this integration <ref target=\"#b36\" type=\"bibr\">[37]</ref>. The graphical illustration and the comparison against pure spatial-pachifying are depicted in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_5\" type=\"figure\">9</ref>. Similar to spatial-patch compression, employing spatialtemporal-patch compression with predetermined convolution kernel parameters -such as fixed kernel sizes, strides, and output channels -results in variations in the dimensions of the latent space due to the differing characteristics of video inputs. This variability is primarily driven by the diverse durations and resolutions of the videos being processed. To mitigate this challenge, the approaches adopted for spatial patchification are equally applicable and effective in this context. In summary, we reverse engineer the two patch-level compression approaches based on VAE or its variant like VQ-VQE because operations on patches are more flexible to process different types of videos. Since Sora aims to generate high-fidelity videos, a large patch size or kernel size is used for efficient compression. Here, we expect that fixed-size patches are used for simplicity, scalability, and training stability. But varying-size patches could also be used <ref target=\"#b38\" type=\"bibr\">[39]</ref> to make the dimension of the whole frames or videos in latent space consistent. However, it may result in invalid positional encoding, and cause challenges for the decoder to generate videos with varying-size latent patches. </p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.2.4\">Spacetime Latent Patches</head><p>There is a pivotal concern remaining in the compression network part: How to handle the variability in latent space dimensions (i.e., the number of latent feature chunks or patches from different video types) before feeding patches into the input layers of the diffusion transformer. Here, we discuss several solutions.</p><p>Based on Sora's technical report and the corresponding references, patch n' pack (PNP) <ref target=\"#b39\" type=\"bibr\">[40]</ref> is likely the solution. PNP packs multiple patches from different images in a single sequence as shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_6\" type=\"figure\">10</ref>. This method is inspired by example packing used in natural language processing <ref target=\"#b40\" type=\"bibr\">[41]</ref> that accommodates efficient training on variable length inputs by dropping tokens. Here the patchification and token embedding steps need to be completed in the compression network, but Sora may further patchify the latent for transformer token as Diffusion Transformer does <ref target=\"#b3\" type=\"bibr\">[4]</ref>. Regardless there is a second-round patchification or not, we need to address two concerns, how to pack those tokens in a compact manner and how to control which tokens should be dropped. For the first concern, a simple greedy approach is used which adds examples to the first sequence with enough remaining space. Once no more example can fit, sequences are filled with padding tokens, yielding the fixed sequence lengths needed for batched operations. Such a simple packing algorithm can lead to significant padding, depending on the distribution of the length of inputs. On the other hand, we can control the resolutions and frames we sample to ensure efficient packing by tuning the sequence length and limiting padding. For the second concern, an intuitive approach is to drop the similar tokens <ref target=\"#b41\" type=\"bibr\">[42,</ref><ref target=\"#b42\" type=\"bibr\">43,</ref><ref target=\"#b32\" type=\"bibr\">33,</ref><ref target=\"#b43\" type=\"bibr\">44]</ref> or, like PNP, apply dropping rate schedulers. However, it is worth noting that 3D Consistency is one of the nice properties of Sora. Dropping tokens may ignore fine-grained details during training. Thus, we believe that OpenAI is likely to use a super long context window and pack all tokens from videos although doing so is computationally expensive e.g., the multi-head attention <ref target=\"#b44\" type=\"bibr\">[45,</ref><ref target=\"#b45\" type=\"bibr\">46]</ref> operator exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length. Specifically, spacetime latent patches from a long-duration video can be packed in one sequence while the ones from several short-duration videos are concatenated in the other sequence.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.2.5\">Discussion</head><p>We discuss two technical solutions to data pre-processing that Sora may use. Both solutions are performed at the patch level due to the characteristics of flexibility and scalability for modeling. Different from previous approaches where videos are resized, cropped, or trimmed to a standard size, Sora trains on data at its native size. Although there are several benefits (see detailed analysis in Section 3.2.1), it brings some technical challenges, among which one of the most significant is that neural networks cannot inherently process visual data of variable durations, resolutions, and aspect ratios. Through reverse engineering, we believe that Sora firstly compresses visual patches into low-dimensional latent representations, and arranges such latent patches or further patchified latent patches in a sequence, then injects noise into these latent patches .</p><p>before feeding them to the input layer of diffusion transformer. Spatial-temporal patchification is adopted by Sora because it is simple to implement, and it can effectively reduce the context length with highinformation-density tokens and decrease the complexity of subsequent modeling of temporal information.</p><p>To the research community, we recommend using cost-efficient alternative solutions for video compression and representation, including utilizing pre-trained checkpoints (e.g., compression network) <ref target=\"#b46\" type=\"bibr\">[47]</ref>, shortening the context window, using light-weight modeling mechanisms such as (grouped) multi-query attention <ref target=\"#b47\" type=\"bibr\">[48,</ref><ref target=\"#b48\" type=\"bibr\">49]</ref> or efficient architectures (e.g. Mamba <ref target=\"#b49\" type=\"bibr\">[50]</ref>), downsampling data and dropping tokens if necessary. The trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency for video modeling is an important research topic to be explored.</p></div>\n",

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.3.1\">Diffusion Transformer</head><p>Image Diffusion Transformer. Traditional diffusion models <ref target=\"#b50\" type=\"bibr\">[51,</ref><ref target=\"#b51\" type=\"bibr\">52,</ref><ref target=\"#b52\" type=\"bibr\">53]</ref> mainly leverage convolutional U-Nets that include downsampling and upsampling blocks for the denoising network backbone. However, recent studies show that the U-Net architecture is not crucial to the good performance of the diffusion model. By incorporating a more flexible transformer architecture, the transformer-based diffusion models can use more training data and larger model parameters. Along this line, DiT <ref target=\"#b3\" type=\"bibr\">[4]</ref> and U-ViT <ref target=\"#b53\" type=\"bibr\">[54]</ref> are among the first works to employ vision transformers for latent diffusion models. As in ViT, DiT employs a multi-head selfattention layer and a pointwise feed-forward network interlaced with some layer norm and scaling layers. Moreover, as shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_7\" type=\"figure\">11</ref>, DiT incorporates conditioning via adaptive layer norm (AdaLN) with an additional MLP layer for zero-initializing, which initializes each residual block as an identity function and thus greatly stabilizes the training process. The scalability and flexibility of DiT is empirically validated. DiT becomes the new backbone for diffusion models. In U-ViT, as shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_7\" type=\"figure\">11</ref>, they treat all inputs, including time, condition, and noisy image patches, as tokens and propose long skip connections between the shallow and deep transformer layers. The results suggest that the downsampling and upsampling operators in CNN-based U-Net are not always necessary, and U-ViT achieves record-breaking FID scores in image and text-to-image generation.</p><p>Like Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) <ref target=\"#b32\" type=\"bibr\">[33]</ref>, Masked Diffusion Transformer (MDT) <ref target=\"#b54\" type=\"bibr\">[55]</ref> incorporates mask latent modeling into the diffusion process to explicitly enhance contextual relation learning among object semantic parts in image synthesis. Specifically, as shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_0\" type=\"figure\">12</ref>, MDT uses a side-interpolated for an additional masked token reconstruction task during training to boost the training efficiency and learn powerful context-aware positional embedding for inference. Compared to DiT <ref target=\"#b3\" type=\"bibr\">[4]</ref>, MDT achieves better performance and faster learning speed. Instead of using AdaLN (i.e., shifting and scaling) for time-conditioning modeling, Hatamizadeh et al. <ref target=\"#b55\" type=\"bibr\">[56]</ref> introduce Diffusion Vision Transformers (DiffiT), which uses a timedependent self-attention (TMSA) module to model dynamic denoising behavior over sampling time steps. Besides, DiffiT uses two hybrid hierarchical architectures for efficient denoising in the pixel space and the latent space, respectively, and achieves new state-of-the-art results across various generation tasks. Overall, these studies show promising results in employing vision transformers for image latent diffusion, paving the way for future studies for other modalities. Video Diffusion Transformer. Building upon the foundational works in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, recent research has been focused on realizing the potential of diffusion transformers for text-to-video (T2V) generation tasks. Due to the temporal nature of videos, key challenges for applying DiTs in the video domain are: i) how to compress the video spatially and temporally to a latent space for efficient denoising; ii) how to convert the compressed latent to patches and feed them to the transformer; and iii) how to handle long-range temporal and spatial dependencies and ensure content consistency. Please refer to Section 3.2.3 for the first challenge. In this Section, we focus our discussion on transformer-based denoising network architectures designed to operate in the spatially and temporally compressed latent space. We give a detailed review of the two important works (Imagen Video <ref target=\"#b28\" type=\"bibr\">[29]</ref> and Video LDM <ref target=\"#b35\" type=\"bibr\">[36]</ref>) described in the reference list of the OpenAI Sora technique report.</p><p>Imagen Video <ref target=\"#b28\" type=\"bibr\">[29]</ref>, a text-to-video generation system developed by Google Research, utilizes a cascade of diffusion models, which consists of 7 sub-models that perform text-conditional video generation, spatial super-resolution, and temporal super-resolution, to transform textual prompts into high-definition videos. As shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_1\" type=\"figure\">13</ref>, firstly, a frozen T5 text encoder generates contextual embeddings from the input text prompt. These embeddings are critical for aligning the generated video with the text prompt and are injected into all models in the cascade, in addition to the base model. Subsequently, the embedding is fed to the base model for low-resolution video generation, which is then refined by cascaded diffusion models to increase the resolution. The base video and super-resolution models use a 3D U-Net architecture in a spacetime separable fashion. This architecture weaves temporal attention and convolution layers with spatial counterparts to efficiently capture inter-frame dependencies. It employs v-prediction parameterization for numerical stability and conditioning augmentation to facilitate parallel training across models. The process involves joint training on both images and videos, treating each image as a frame to leverage larger datasets, and using classifier-free guidance <ref target=\"#b56\" type=\"bibr\">[57]</ref> to enhance prompt fidelity. Progressive distillation <ref target=\"#b57\" type=\"bibr\">[58]</ref> is applied to streamline the sampling process, significantly reducing the computational load while maintaining perceptual quality. Combining these methods and techniques allows Imagen Video to generate videos with not only high fidelity but also remarkable controllability, as demonstrated by its ability to produce diverse videos, text animations, and content in various artistic styles.  Blattmann et al. <ref target=\"#b35\" type=\"bibr\">[36]</ref> propose to turn a 2D Latent Diffusion Model into a Video Latent Diffusion Model (Video LDM). They achieve this by adding some post-hoc temporal layers among the existing spatial layers into both the U-Net backbone and the VAE decoder that learns to align individual frames. These temporal layers are trained on encoded video data, while the spatial layers remain fixed, allowing the model to leverage large image datasets for pre-training. The LDM's decoder is fine-tuned for temporal consistency in pixel space and temporally aligning diffusion model upsamplers for enhanced spatial resolution. To generate very long videos, models are trained to predict a future frame given a number of context frames, allowing for classifier-free guidance during sampling. To achieve high temporal resolution, the video synthesis process is divided into key frame generation and interpolation between these key frames. Following cascaded LDMs, a DM is used to further scale up the Video LDM outputs by 4 times, ensuring high spatial resolution while maintaining temporal consistency. This approach enables the generation of globally coherent long videos in a computationally efficient manner. Additionally, the authors demonstrate the ability to transform pre-trained image LDMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion) into text-to-video models by training only the temporal alignment layers, achieving video synthesis with resolutions up to 1280 × 2048.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.3.2\">Discussion</head><p>Cascade diffusion models for spatial and temporal up-sampling. Sora can generate high-resolution videos. By reviewing existing works and our reverse engineering, we speculate that Sora also leverages cascade diffusion model architecture <ref target=\"#b58\" type=\"bibr\">[59]</ref> which is composed of a base model and many space-time refiner models. The attention modules are unlikely to be heavily used in the based diffusion model and lowresolution diffusion model, considering the high computation cost and limited performance gain of using attention machines in high-resolution cases. For spatial and temporal scene consistency, as previous works show that temporal consistency is more important than spatial consistency for video/scene generation, Sora is likely to leverage an efficient training strategy by using longer video (for temporal consistency) with lower resolution. Moreover, Sora is likely to use a v-parameterization diffusion model <ref target=\"#b57\" type=\"bibr\">[58]</ref>, considering its superior performance compared to other variants that predict the original latent x or the noise ϵ.</p><p>On the latent encoder. For training efficiency, most of the existing works leverage the pre-trained VAE encoder of Stable Diffusions <ref target=\"#b59\" type=\"bibr\">[60,</ref><ref target=\"#b60\" type=\"bibr\">61]</ref>, a pre-trained 2D diffusion model, as an initialized model checkpoint. However, the encoder lacks the temporal compression ability. Even though some works propose to only fine-tune the decoder for handling temporal information, the decoder's performance of dealing with video temporal data in the compressed latent space remains sub-optimal. Based on the technique report, our reverse engineering shows that, instead of using an existing pre-trained VAE encoder, it is likely that Sora uses a space-time VAE encoder, trained from scratch on video data, which performs better than existing ones with a video-orient compressed latent space.</p></div>\n",

This improved capability in prompt following enables models to generate output that more closely resembles human responses to natural language queries. We start our discussion with a review of instruction following techniques for large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image models such as DALL•E 3. To enhance the text-to-video model's ability to follow text instructions, Sora utilizes an approach similar to that of DALL•E 3. The approach involves training a descriptive captioner and utilizing the captioner's generated data for fine-tuning.

The poor quality of data, particularly the prevalence of noisy data and short captions that omit a large amount of visual information, leads to many issues such as neglecting keywords and word order, and misunderstanding the user intentions <ref target=\"#b20\" type=\"bibr\">[21]</ref>. The caption improvement approach addresses these issues by re-captioning existing images with detailed, descriptive captions. The approach first trains an image captioner, which is a vision-language model, to generate precise and descriptive image captions. The resulting descriptive image captions by the captioner are then used to fine-tune text-to-image models. Specifically, DALL•E 3 follows contrastive captioners (CoCa) <ref target=\"#b67\" type=\"bibr\">[68]</ref> to jointly train an image captioner with a CLIP <ref target=\"#b25\" type=\"bibr\">[26]</ref> architecture and a language model objective. This image captioner incorporates an image encoder a unimodal text encoder for extracting language information, and a multimodal text decoder. It first employs a contrastive loss between unimodal image and text embeddings, followed by a captioning loss for the multimodal decoder's outputs. The resulting image captioner is further fine-tuned on a highly detailed description of images covering main objects, surroundings, backgrounds, texts, styles, and colorations. With this step, the image captioner is able to generate detailed descriptive captions for the images. The training dataset for the text-to-image model is a mixture of the re-captioned dataset generated by the image captioner and ground-truth human-written data to ensure that the model captures user inputs. This image caption improvement method introduces a potential issue: a mismatch between the actual user prompts and descriptive image descriptions from the training data. DALL•E 3 addresses this by upsampling, where LLMs are used to re-write short user prompts into detailed and lengthy instructions. This ensures that the model's text inputs received in inference time are consistent with those in model training.</p></div>\n",

This method is achieved by first training a video captioner capable of producing detailed descriptions for videos. Then, this video captioner is applied to all videos in the training data to generate high-quality (video, descriptive caption) pairs, which are used to fine-tune Sora to improve its instruction following ability.</p><p>Sora's technical report <ref target=\"#b2\" type=\"bibr\">[3]</ref> does not reveal the details about how the video captioner is trained. Given that the video captioner is a video-to-text model, there are many approaches to building it. A straightforward approach is to utilize CoCa architecture for video captioning by taking multiple frames of a video and feeding each frame into the image encoder <ref target=\"#b67\" type=\"bibr\">[68]</ref>, known as VideoCoCa <ref target=\"#b68\" type=\"bibr\">[69]</ref>. VideoCoCa builds upon CoCa and re-uses the image encoder pre-trained weights and applies it independently on sampled video frames. The resulting frame token embeddings are flattened and concatenated into a long sequence of video representations. These flattened frame tokens are then processed by a generative pooler and a contrastive pooler, which are jointly trained with the contrastive loss and captioning loss. Other alternatives to building video captioners include mPLUG-2 <ref target=\"#b69\" type=\"bibr\">[70]</ref>, GIT <ref target=\"#b70\" type=\"bibr\">[71]</ref>, FrozenBiLM <ref target=\"#b71\" type=\"bibr\">[72]</ref>, and more.

The prompts for Sora cover a wide range of scenarios. Recent works (e.g., VoP <ref target=\"#b76\" type=\"bibr\">[77]</ref>, Make-A-Video <ref target=\"#b27\" type=\"bibr\">[28]</ref>, and Tune-A-Video <ref target=\"#b77\" type=\"bibr\">[78]</ref>) have shown how prompt engineering leverages model's natural language understanding ability to decode complex instructions and render them into cohesive, lively, and high-quality video narratives. As shown in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_2\" type=\"figure\">15</ref>, \"a stylish woman walking down a neon-lit Tokyo street...\" is such a meticulously crafted text prompt that it ensures Sora to generate a video that aligns well with the expected vision. The quality of prompt engineering depends on the careful selection of words, the specificity of the details provided, and comprehension of their impact on the model's output. For example, the prompt in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_2\" type=\"figure\">15</ref> specifies in detail the actions, settings, character appearances, and even the desired mood and atmosphere of the scene.

This issue extends to the simulation of motion, where Sora generates movements that challenge realistic physical modeling, such as unnatural transformations of objects or the incorrect simulation of rigid structures like chairs, leading to unrealistic physical interactions. The challenge further increases when simulating complex interactions among objects and characters, occasionally producing outcomes that lean towards the humorous.</p><p>Spatial and Temporal Complexities. Sora occasionally misunderstands instructions related to the placement or arrangement of objects and characters within a given prompt, leading to confusion about directions (e.g., confusing left for right). Additionally, it faces challenges in maintaining the temporal accuracy of events, particularly when it comes to adhering to designated camera movements or sequences. This can result in deviating from the intended temporal flow of scenes. In complex scenarios that involve a multitude of characters or elements, Sora has a tendency to insert irrelevant animals or people. Such additions can significantly change the originally envisioned composition and atmosphere of the scene, moving away from the planned narrative or visual layout. This issue not only affects the model's ability to accurately recreate specific scenes or narratives but also impacts its reliability in generating content that closely aligns with the user's expectations and the coherence of the generated output.</p><p>Limitations in Human-computer Interaction (HCI). Sora, while showing potential in the video generation domain, faces significant limitations in HCI. These limitations are primarily evident in the coherence and efficiency of user-system interactions, especially when making detailed modifications or optimizations to generated content. For instance, users might find it difficult to precisely specify or adjust the presentation of specific elements within a video, such as action details and scene transitions. Additionally, Sora's limi-tations in understanding complex language instructions or capturing subtle semantic differences could result in video content that does not fully meet user expectations or needs. These shortcomings restrict Sora's potential in video editing and enhancement, also impacting the overall satisfaction of the user experience.</p><p>Usage Limitation. Regarding usage limitations, OpenAI has not yet set a specific release date for public access to Sora, emphasizing a cautious approach towards safety and readiness before broad deployment. This indicates that further improvements and testing in areas such as security, privacy protection, and content review may still be necessary for Sora. Moreover, at present, Sora can only generate videos up to one minute in length, and according to published cases, most generated videos are only a few dozen seconds long. This limitation restricts its use in applications requiring longer content display, such as detailed instructional videos or in-depth storytelling. This limitation reduces Sora's flexibility in the content creation.</p></div>\n",

(1) The introduction of Sora by OpenAI marks a strategic shift towards encouraging the broader AI community to delve deeper into the exploration of text-to-video models, leveraging both diffusion and transformer technologies. This initiative aims to redirect the focus toward the potential of creating highly sophisticated and nuanced video content directly from textual descriptions, a frontier that promises to revolutionize content creation, storytelling, and information sharing. <ref target=\"#b1\" type=\"bibr\">(2)</ref> The innovative approach of training Sora on data at its native size, as opposed to the traditional methods of resizing or cropping, serves as a groundbreaking inspiration for the academic community. It opens up new pathways by highlighting the benefits of utilizing unmodified datasets, which leads to the creation of more advanced generative models.</p><p>Industry. (1) The current capabilities of Sora signal a promising path for the advancement of video simulation technologies, highlighting the potential to significantly enhance realism within both physical and digital areas. The prospect of Sora enabling the creation of highly realistic environments through textual descriptions presents a promising future for content creation. This potential extends to revolutionizing game development, offering a glimpse into a future where immersive-generated worlds can be crafted with unprecedented ease and accuracy. (2) Companies may leverage Sora to produce advertising videos that swiftly adapt to market changes and create customized marketing content. This not only reduces production costs but also enhances the appeal and effectiveness of advertisements. The ability of Sora to generate highly realistic video content from textual descriptions alone could revolutionize how brands engage with their audience, allowing for the creation of immersive and compelling videos that capture the essence of their products or services in unprecedented ways.</p><p>Society. (1) While the prospect of utilizing text-to-video technology to replace traditional filmmaking remains distant, Sora and similar platforms hold transformative potential for content creation on social media. The constraints of current video lengths do not diminish the impact these tools can have in making high-quality video production accessible to everyone, enabling individuals to produce compelling content without the need for expensive equipment. It represents a significant shift towards empowering content creators across platforms like TikTok and Reels, bringing in a new age of creativity and engagement. (2) Screenwriters and creative professionals can use Sora to transform written scripts into videos, assisting them in better showing and sharing their creative concepts, and even in producing short films and animations. The ability to create detailed, vivid videos from scripts can fundamentally change the pre-production process of filmmaking and animation, offering a glimpse into how future storytellers might pitch, develop, and refine their narratives. This technology opens up possibilities for a more dynamic and interactive form of script development, where ideas can be visualized and assessed in real time, providing a powerful tool for creativity and collaboration. (3) Journalists and news organizations can also utilize Sora to quickly generate news reports or explanatory videos, making the news content more vivid and engaging. This can significantly increase the coverage and audience engagement of news reports. By providing a tool that can simulate realistic environments and scenarios, Sora offers a powerful solution for visual storytelling, enabling journalists to convey complex stories through engaging videos that were previously difficult or expensive to produce. In summary, Sora's potential to revolutionize content creation across marketing, journalism, and entertainment is immense.</p></div>\n",

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><p>The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.</p></div>\n",

Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures <ref target=\"#b37\" type=\"bibr\">[38,</ref><ref target=\"#b23\" type=\"bibr\">24,</ref><ref target=\"#b14\" type=\"bibr\">15]</ref>.</p><p>Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t−1 and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks <ref target=\"#b20\" type=\"bibr\">[21]</ref> and conditional computation <ref target=\"#b31\" type=\"bibr\">[32]</ref>, while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.</p><p>Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences <ref target=\"#b1\" type=\"bibr\">[2,</ref><ref target=\"#b18\" type=\"bibr\">19]</ref>. In all but a few cases <ref target=\"#b26\" type=\"bibr\">[27]</ref>, however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.</p><p>In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.</p></div>\n",

In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions <ref target=\"#b11\" type=\"bibr\">[12]</ref>. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.</p><p>Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations <ref target=\"#b3\" type=\"bibr\">[4,</ref><ref target=\"#b26\" type=\"bibr\">27,</ref><ref target=\"#b27\" type=\"bibr\">28,</ref><ref target=\"#b21\" type=\"bibr\">22]</ref>. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks <ref target=\"#b33\" type=\"bibr\">[34]</ref>.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as <ref target=\"#b16\" type=\"bibr\">[17,</ref><ref target=\"#b17\" type=\"bibr\">18]</ref> and <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">[9]</ref>.</p></div>\n",

Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x 1 , ..., x n ) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z 1 , ..., z n ). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y 1 , ..., y m ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive <ref target=\"#b9\" type=\"bibr\">[10]</ref>, consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure <ref target=\"#fig_0\" type=\"figure\">1</ref>, respectively.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.1\">Encoder and Decoder Stacks</head><p>Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection <ref target=\"#b10\" type=\"bibr\">[11]</ref> around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">[1]</ref>. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512.</p><p>Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.</p></div>\n",

Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.</p><p>• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections.

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.5\">Positional Encoding</head><p>Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">[9]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_9\">P E (pos,2i) = sin(pos/10000 2i/dmodel ) P E (pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/10000 2i/dmodel )</formula><p>where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 • 2π. We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P E pos+k can be represented as a linear function of P E pos .</p><p>We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">[9]</ref> instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table <ref target=\"#tab_3\" type=\"table\">3</ref> row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"4\">Why Self-Attention</head><p>In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x 1 , ..., x n ) to another sequence of equal length (z 1 , ..., z n ), with x i , z i ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.</p><p>One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.</p><p>The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies <ref target=\"#b11\" type=\"bibr\">[12]</ref>. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.</p><p>As noted in Table <ref target=\"#tab_0\" type=\"table\">1</ref>, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece <ref target=\"#b37\" type=\"bibr\">[38]</ref> and byte-pair <ref target=\"#b30\" type=\"bibr\">[31]</ref> representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.</p><p>A single convolutional layer with kernel width k &lt; n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O(log k (n)) in the case of dilated convolutions <ref target=\"#b17\" type=\"bibr\">[18]</ref>, increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions <ref target=\"#b5\" type=\"bibr\">[6]</ref>, however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O(k</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_10\">• n • d + n • d 2 )</formula><p>. Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.</p><p>As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.</p></div>\n",

We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.</p><p>The code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor.</p></div>\n",

In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller generalpurpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be finetuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study.</p></div>\n",

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"1\">Introduction</head><p>The last two years have seen the rise of Transfer Learning approaches in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with large-scale pre-trained language models becoming a basic tool in many NLP tasks <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">[Devlin et al., 2018</ref><ref target=\"#b1\" type=\"bibr\">, Radford et al., 2019</ref>. While these models lead to significant improvement, they often have several hundred million parameters and current research 1 on pre-trained models indicates that training even larger models still leads to better performances on downstream tasks.</p><p>The trend toward bigger models raises several concerns. First is the environmental cost of exponentially scaling these models' computational requirements as mentioned in <ref type=\"bibr\">Schwartz et al. [2019]</ref>, <ref target=\"#b3\" type=\"bibr\">Strubell et al. [2019]</ref>. Second, while operating these models on-device in real-time has the potential to enable novel and interesting language processing applications, the growing computational and memory requirements of these models may hamper wide adoption.</p><p>In this paper, we show that it is possible to reach similar performances on many downstream-tasks using much smaller language models pre-trained with knowledge distillation, resulting in models that are lighter and faster at inference time, while also requiring a smaller computational training budget. Our general-purpose pre-trained models can be fine-tuned with good performances on several downstream tasks, keeping the flexibility of larger models. We also show that our compressed models are small enough to run on the edge, e.g. on mobile devices.</p><p>Using a triple loss, we show that a 40% smaller Transformer <ref target=\"#b4\" type=\"bibr\">(Vaswani et al. [2017]</ref>) pre-trained through distillation via the supervision of a bigger Transformer language model can achieve similar performance on a variety of downstream tasks, while being 60% faster at inference time. Further ablation studies indicate that all the components of the triple loss are important for best performances.</p><p>We have made the trained weights available along with the training code in the Transformers 2 library from HuggingFace <ref target=\"#b5\" type=\"bibr\">[Wolf et al., 2019]</ref>.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"2\">Knowledge distillation</head><p>Knowledge distillation <ref target=\"#b6\" type=\"bibr\">[Bucila et al., 2006</ref><ref target=\"#b7\" type=\"bibr\">, Hinton et al., 2015</ref>] is a compression technique in which a compact model -the student -is trained to reproduce the behaviour of a larger model -the teacheror an ensemble of models.</p><p>In supervised learning, a classification model is generally trained to predict an instance class by maximizing the estimated probability of gold labels. A standard training objective thus involves minimizing the cross-entropy between the model's predicted distribution and the one-hot empirical distribution of training labels. A model performing well on the training set will predict an output distribution with high probability on the correct class and with near-zero probabilities on other classes. But some of these \"near-zero\" probabilities are larger than others and reflect, in part, the generalization capabilities of the model and how well it will perform on the test set <ref type=\"bibr\">3</ref> .</p><p>Training loss The student is trained with a distillation loss over the soft target probabilities of the teacher: L ce = i t i * log(s i ) where t i (resp. s i ) is a probability estimated by the teacher (resp. the student). This objective results in a rich training signal by leveraging the full teacher distribution. Following <ref target=\"#b7\" type=\"bibr\">Hinton et al. [2015]</ref> we used a softmax-temperature:</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_0\">p i = exp(zi/T ) j exp(zj /T )</formula><p>where T controls the smoothness of the output distribution and z i is the model score for the class i. The same temperature T is applied to the student and the teacher at training time, while at inference, T is set to 1 to recover a standard softmax.</p><p>The final training objective is a linear combination of the distillation loss L ce with the supervised training loss, in our case the masked language modeling loss L mlm <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">[Devlin et al., 2018]</ref>. We found it beneficial to add a cosine embedding loss (L cos ) which will tend to align the directions of the student and teacher hidden states vectors.</p><p>3 DistilBERT: a distilled version of BERT Student architecture In the present work, the student -DistilBERT -has the same general architecture as BERT. The token-type embeddings and the pooler are removed while the number of layers is reduced by a factor of 2. Most of the operations used in the Transformer architecture (linear layer and layer normalisation) are highly optimized in modern linear algebra frameworks and our investigations showed that variations on the last dimension of the tensor (hidden size dimension) have a smaller impact on computation efficiency (for a fixed parameters budget) than variations on other factors like the number of layers. Thus we focus on reducing the number of layers.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Student initialization</head><p>In addition to the previously described optimization and architectural choices, an important element in our training procedure is to find the right initialization for the sub-network to converge. Taking advantage of the common dimensionality between teacher and student networks, we initialize the student from the teacher by taking one layer out of two. </p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"4\">Experiments</head><p>General Language Understanding We assess the language understanding and generalization capabilities of DistilBERT on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark <ref target=\"#b9\" type=\"bibr\">[Wang et al., 2018]</ref>, a collection of 9 datasets for evaluating natural language understanding systems. We report scores on the development sets for each task by fine-tuning DistilBERT without the use of ensembling or multi-tasking scheme for fine-tuning (which are mostly orthogonal to the present work). We compare the results to the baseline provided by the authors of GLUE: an ELMo <ref target=\"#b10\" type=\"bibr\">(Peters et al. [2018]</ref>) encoder followed by two BiLSTMs. 4</p><p>The results on each of the 9 tasks are showed on Table <ref target=\"#tab_0\" type=\"table\">1</ref> along with the macro-score (average of individual scores). Among the 9 tasks, DistilBERT is always on par or improving over the ELMo baseline (up to 19 points of accuracy on STS-B). DistilBERT also compares surprisingly well to BERT, retaining 97% of the performance with 40% fewer parameters.</p></div>\n",

[2011]</ref>) and a question answering task <ref type=\"bibr\">(SQuAD v1.1 -Rajpurkar et al. [2016]</ref>).</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type=\"table\">2</ref>, DistilBERT is only 0.6% point behind BERT in test accuracy on the IMDb benchmark while being 40% smaller. On SQuAD, DistilBERT is within 3.9 points of the full BERT.</p><p>We also studied whether we could add another step of distillation during the adaptation phase by fine-tuning DistilBERT on SQuAD using a BERT model previously fine-tuned on SQuAD as a </p><formula xml:id=\"formula_1\">∅ -L cos -L mlm -2.96 L ce -∅ -L mlm -1.46 L ce -L cos -∅ -0.</formula><p>31 Triple loss + random weights initialization -3.69</p><p>teacher for an additional term in the loss (knowledge distillation). In this setting, there are thus two successive steps of distillation, one during the pre-training phase and one during the adaptation phase.</p><p>In this case, we were able to reach interesting performances given the size of the model: 79.8 F1 and 70.4 EM, i.e. within 3 points of the full model.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Size and inference speed</head><p>To further investigate the speed-up/size trade-off of DistilBERT, we compare (in Table <ref type=\"table\">3</ref>) the number of parameters of each model along with the inference time needed to do a full pass on the STS-B development set on CPU (Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 Haswell @2.9GHz) using a batch size of 1. DistilBERT has 40% fewer parameters than BERT and is 60% faster than BERT.</p><p>On device computation We studied whether DistilBERT could be used for on-the-edge applications by building a mobile application for question answering. We compare the average inference time on a recent smartphone (iPhone 7 Plus) against our previously trained question answering model based on BERT-base. Excluding the tokenization step, DistilBERT is 71% faster than BERT, and the whole model weighs 207 MB (which could be further reduced with quantization). Our code is available 5 .</p></div>\n",

We report the macro-score on GLUE. Table <ref target=\"#tab_1\" type=\"table\">4</ref> presents the deltas with the full triple loss: removing the Masked Language Modeling loss has little impact while the two distillation losses account for a large portion of the performance.</p></div>\n",

[2019]</ref> use the original pretraining objective to train smaller student, then fine-tuned via distillation. As shown in the ablation study, we found it beneficial to leverage the teacher's knowledge to pre-train with additional distillation signal.</p><p>Multi-distillation <ref target=\"#b16\" type=\"bibr\">Yang et al. [2019]</ref> combine the knowledge of an ensemble of teachers using multi-task learning to regularize the distillation. The authors apply Multi-Task Knowledge Distillation to learn a compact question answering model from a set of large question answering models. An application of multi-distillation is multi-linguality: <ref target=\"#b17\" type=\"bibr\">Tsai et al. [2019]</ref> adopts a similar approach to us by pre-training a multilingual model from scratch solely through distillation. However, as shown in the ablation study, leveraging the teacher's knowledge with initialization and additional losses leads to substantial gains.</p><p>Other compression techniques have been studied to compress large models. Recent developments in weights pruning reveal that it is possible to remove some heads in the self-attention at test time without significantly degrading the performance <ref target=\"#b18\" type=\"bibr\">Michel et al. [2019]</ref>. Some layers can be reduced to one head. A separate line of study leverages quantization to derive smaller models <ref target=\"#b19\" type=\"bibr\">(Gupta et al. [2015]</ref>). Pruning and quantization are orthogonal to the present work.</p></div>\n",

We further demonstrated that DistilBERT is a compelling option for edge applications.</p></div><figure xml:id=\"fig_0\" xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Parameter counts of several recently released pretrained language models.</figDesc></figure>\n",

As such, DistilBERT is distilled on very large batches leveraging gradient accumulation (up to 4K examples per batch) using dynamic masking and without the next sentence prediction objective.Data and compute power We train DistilBERT on the same corpus as the original BERT model: a concatenation of English Wikipedia and Toronto Book Corpus<ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">[Zhu et al., 2015]</ref>. DistilBERT was trained on 8 16GB V100 GPUs for approximately 90 hours. For the sake of comparison, the RoBERTa model required 1 day of training on 1024 32GB V100.</note></figure>\n",

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><p>We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models <ref target=\"#b35\" type=\"bibr\">(Peters et al., 2018a;</ref><ref target=\"#b37\" type=\"bibr\">Radford et al., 2018)</ref>, BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications.</p><p>BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).</p></div>\n",

These include sentence-level tasks such as natural language inference <ref target=\"#b5\" type=\"bibr\">(Bowman et al., 2015;</ref><ref target=\"#b50\" type=\"bibr\">Williams et al., 2018)</ref> and paraphrasing <ref target=\"#b16\" type=\"bibr\">(Dolan and Brockett, 2005)</ref>, which aim to predict the relationships between sentences by analyzing them holistically, as well as token-level tasks such as named entity recognition and question answering, where models are required to produce fine-grained output at the token level (Tjong Kim <ref target=\"#b43\" type=\"bibr\">Sang and De Meulder, 2003;</ref><ref target=\"#b38\" type=\"bibr\">Rajpurkar et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>There are two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The feature-based approach, such as ELMo <ref target=\"#b35\" type=\"bibr\">(Peters et al., 2018a)</ref>, uses task-specific architectures that include the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) <ref target=\"#b37\" type=\"bibr\">(Radford et al., 2018)</ref>, introduces minimal task-specific parameters, and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pretrained parameters. The two approaches share the same objective function during pre-training, where they use unidirectional language models to learn general language representations.</p><p>We argue that current techniques restrict the power of the pre-trained representations, especially for the fine-tuning approaches. The major limitation is that standard language models are unidirectional, and this limits the choice of architectures that can be used during pre-training. For example, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-toright architecture, where every token can only attend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers of the Transformer <ref target=\"#b45\" type=\"bibr\">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>. Such restrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks, and could be very harmful when applying finetuning based approaches to token-level tasks such as question answering, where it is crucial to incorporate context from both directions.</p><p>In this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a \"masked language model\" (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task <ref target=\"#b42\" type=\"bibr\">(Taylor, 1953)</ref>. The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. Unlike left-toright language model pre-training, the MLM objective enables the representation to fuse the left and the right context, which allows us to pretrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addition to the masked language model, we also use a \"next sentence prediction\" task that jointly pretrains text-pair representations. The contributions of our paper are as follows:</p><p>• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional pre-training for language representations. Unlike <ref target=\"#b37\" type=\"bibr\">Radford et al. (2018)</ref>, which uses unidirectional language models for pre-training, BERT uses masked language models to enable pretrained deep bidirectional representations. This is also in contrast to <ref target=\"#b35\" type=\"bibr\">Peters et al. (2018a)</ref>, which uses a shallow concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.</p><p>• We show that pre-trained representations reduce the need for many heavily-engineered taskspecific architectures. BERT is the first finetuning based representation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large suite of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outperforming many task-specific architectures.</p><p>• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven NLP tasks.

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3\">BERT</head><p>We introduce BERT and its detailed implementation in this section. There are two steps in our framework: pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled data over different pre-training tasks. For finetuning, the BERT model is first initialized with the pre-trained parameters, and all of the parameters are fine-tuned using labeled data from the downstream tasks. Each downstream task has separate fine-tuned models, even though they are initialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The question-answering example in Figure <ref type=\"figure\">1</ref> will serve as a running example for this section.</p><p>A distinctive feature of BERT is its unified architecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architecture and the final downstream architecture.</p><p>Model Architecture BERT's model architecture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder based on the original implementation described in <ref target=\"#b45\" type=\"bibr\">Vaswani et al. (2017)</ref> and released in the tensor2tensor library. 1 Because the use of Transformers has become common and our implementation is almost identical to the original, we will omit an exhaustive background description of the model architecture and refer readers to <ref target=\"#b45\" type=\"bibr\">Vaswani et al. (2017)</ref> as well as excellent guides such as \"The Annotated Transformer.\" <ref type=\"bibr\">2</ref> In this work, we denote the number of layers (i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as H, and the number of self-attention heads as A. <ref type=\"bibr\">3</ref> We primarily report results on two model sizes: BERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-eters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L=24, H=1024, A=16, Total Parameters=340M).</p><p>BERT BASE was chosen to have the same model size as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes. Critically, however, the BERT Transformer uses bidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Transformer uses constrained self-attention where every token can only attend to context to its left. <ref type=\"bibr\">4</ref> Input/Output Representations To make BERT handle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input representation is able to unambiguously represent both a single sentence and a pair of sentences (e.g., Question, Answer ) in one token sequence. Throughout this work, a \"sentence\" can be an arbitrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual linguistic sentence. A \"sequence\" refers to the input token sequence to BERT, which may be a single sentence or two sentences packed together.</p><p>We use WordPiece embeddings <ref target=\"#b51\" type=\"bibr\">(Wu et al., 2016)</ref> with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The first token of every sequence is always a special classification token <ref type=\"bibr\">([CLS]</ref>). The final hidden state corresponding to this token is used as the aggregate sequence representation for classification tasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a single sequence. We differentiate the sentences in two ways. First, we separate them with a special token <ref type=\"bibr\">([SEP]</ref>). Second, we add a learned embedding to every token indicating whether it belongs to sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure <ref type=\"figure\">1</ref>, we denote input embedding as E, the final hidden vector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈ R H , and the final hidden vector for the i th input token as</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_1\">T i ∈ R H .</formula><p>For a given token, its input representation is constructed by summing the corresponding token, segment, and position embeddings. A visualization of this construction can be seen in Figure <ref target=\"#fig_0\" type=\"figure\">2</ref>.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.1\">Pre-training BERT</head><p>Unlike <ref target=\"#b35\" type=\"bibr\">Peters et al. (2018a)</ref> and <ref target=\"#b37\" type=\"bibr\">Radford et al. (2018)</ref>, we do not use traditional left-to-right or right-to-left language models to pre-train BERT. Instead, we pre-train BERT using two unsupervised tasks, described in this section. This step is presented in the left part of Figure <ref type=\"figure\">1</ref>.</p><p>Task #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reasonable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is strictly more powerful than either a left-to-right model or the shallow concatenation of a left-toright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately, standard conditional language models can only be trained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirectional conditioning would allow each word to indirectly \"see itself\", and the model could trivially predict the target word in a multi-layered context.</p><p>former is often referred to as a \"Transformer encoder\" while the left-context-only version is referred to as a \"Transformer decoder\" since it can be used for text generation.</p><p>In order to train a deep bidirectional representation, we simply mask some percentage of the input tokens at random, and then predict those masked tokens. We refer to this procedure as a \"masked LM\" (MLM), although it is often referred to as a Cloze task in the literature <ref target=\"#b42\" type=\"bibr\">(Taylor, 1953)</ref>. In this case, the final hidden vectors corresponding to the mask tokens are fed into an output softmax over the vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our experiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece tokens in each sequence at random. In contrast to denoising auto-encoders <ref target=\"#b46\" type=\"bibr\">(Vincent et al., 2008)</ref>, we only predict the masked words rather than reconstructing the entire input.</p><p>Although this allows us to obtain a bidirectional pre-trained model, a downside is that we are creating a mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not appear during fine-tuning. To mitigate this, we do not always replace \"masked\" words with the actual [MASK] token. The training data generator chooses 15% of the token positions at random for prediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace the i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of the time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3) the unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then, T i will be used to predict the original token with cross entropy loss. We compare variations of this procedure in Appendix C.2.</p><p>Task #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) Many important downstream tasks such as Question Answering (QA) and Natural Language Inference (NLI) are based on understanding the relationship between two sentences, which is not directly captured by language modeling. In order to train a model that understands sentence relationships, we pre-train for a binarized next sentence prediction task that can be trivially generated from any monolingual corpus. Specifically, when choosing the sentences A and B for each pretraining example, 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext), and 50% of the time it is a random sentence from the corpus (labeled as NotNext). As we show in Figure <ref type=\"figure\">1</ref>, C is used for next sentence prediction (NSP). 5 Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this task is very beneficial to both QA and NLI. 6  The NSP task is closely related to representationlearning objectives used in <ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">Jernite et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref target=\"#b27\" type=\"bibr\">Logeswaran and Lee (2018)</ref>. However, in prior work, only sentence embeddings are transferred to down-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all parameters to initialize end-task model parameters.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Pre-training data</head><p>The pre-training procedure largely follows the existing literature on language model pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we use the BooksCorpus (800M words)  and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).</p><p>For Wikipedia we extract only the text passages and ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is critical to use a document-level corpus rather than a shuffled sentence-level corpus such as the Billion Word Benchmark <ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">(Chelba et al., 2013)</ref> in order to extract long contiguous sequences.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.2\">Fine-tuning BERT</head><p>Fine-tuning is straightforward since the selfattention mechanism in the Transformer allows BERT to model many downstream taskswhether they involve single text or text pairs-by swapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.</p><p>For applications involving text pairs, a common pattern is to independently encode text pairs before applying bidirectional cross attention, such as Parikh et al. ( <ref type=\"formula\">2016</ref>); <ref target=\"#b39\" type=\"bibr\">Seo et al. (2017)</ref>. BERT instead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify these two stages, as encoding a concatenated text pair with self-attention effectively includes bidirectional cross attention between two sentences.</p><p>For each task, we simply plug in the taskspecific inputs and outputs into BERT and finetune all the parameters end-to-end. At the input, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training are analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphrasing, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3) question-passage pairs in question answering, and (4) a degenerate text-∅ pair in text classification or sequence tagging. At the output, the token representations are fed into an output layer for tokenlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question answering, and the [CLS] representation is fed into an output layer for classification, such as entailment or sentiment analysis.</p><p>Compared to pre-training, fine-tuning is relatively inexpensive. All of the results in the paper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a single Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting from the exact same pre-trained model. <ref type=\"bibr\">7</ref> We describe the task-specific details in the corresponding subsections of Section 4.

The LTR model performs worse than the MLM model on all tasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.</p><p>For SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR model will perform poorly at token predictions, since the token-level hidden states have no rightside context. In order to make a good faith attempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added a randomly initialized BiLSTM on top.

By contrast, BERT BASE contains 110M parameters and BERT LARGE contains 340M parameters.</p><p>It has long been known that increasing the model size will lead to continual improvements on large-scale tasks such as machine translation and language modeling, which is demonstrated by the LM perplexity of held-out training data shown in Table <ref target=\"#tab_13\" type=\"table\">6</ref>. However, we believe that this is the first work to demonstrate convincingly that scaling to extreme model sizes also leads to large improvements on very small scale tasks, provided that the model has been sufficiently pre-trained. <ref target=\"#b36\" type=\"bibr\">Peters et al. (2018b)</ref> presented mixed results on the downstream task impact of increasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two to four layers and <ref target=\"#b29\" type=\"bibr\">Melamud et al. (2016)</ref> mentioned in passing that increasing hidden dimension size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing further to 1,000 did not bring further improvements. Both of these prior works used a featurebased approach -we hypothesize that when the model is fine-tuned directly on the downstream tasks and uses only a very small number of randomly initialized additional parameters, the taskspecific models can benefit from the larger, more expressive pre-trained representations even when downstream task data is very small.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"5.3\">Feature-based Approach with BERT</head><p>All of the BERT results presented so far have used the fine-tuning approach, where a simple classification layer is added to the pre-trained model, and all parameters are jointly fine-tuned on a downstream task. However, the feature-based approach, where fixed features are extracted from the pretrained model, has certain advantages. First, not all tasks can be easily represented by a Transformer encoder architecture, and therefore require a task-specific model architecture to be added. Second, there are major computational benefits to pre-compute an expensive representation of the training data once and then run many experiments with cheaper models on top of this representation.</p><p>In this section, we compare the two approaches by applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim <ref target=\"#b43\" type=\"bibr\">Sang and De Meulder, 2003)</ref>. In the input to BERT, we use a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we include the maximal document context provided by the data. Following standard practice, we formulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF   layer in the output. We use the representation of the first sub-token as the input to the token-level classifier over the NER label set.</p><p>To ablate the fine-tuning approach, we apply the feature-based approach by extracting the activations from one or more layers without fine-tuning any parameters of BERT. These contextual embeddings are used as input to a randomly initialized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before the classification layer.</p><p>Results are presented in Table <ref target=\"#tab_14\" type=\"table\">7</ref>. BERT LARGE performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods. The best performing method concatenates the token representations from the top four hidden layers of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only 0.3 F1 behind fine-tuning the entire model. This demonstrates that BERT is effective for both finetuning and feature-based approaches.</p></div>\n",

The purpose of this is to bias the representation towards the actual observed word.</p><p>The advantage of this procedure is that the Transformer encoder does not know which words it will be asked to predict or which have been replaced by random words, so it is forced to keep a distributional contextual representation of every input token. Additionally, because random replacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens (i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm the model's language understanding capability. In Section C.2, we evaluate the impact this procedure.</p><p>Compared to standard langauge model training, the masked LM only make predictions on 15% of tokens in each batch, which suggests that more pre-training steps may be required for the model </p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>A.2 Pre-training Procedure</head><p>To generate each training input sequence, we sample two spans of text from the corpus, which we refer to as \"sentences\" even though they are typically much longer than single sentences (but can be shorter also). The first sentence receives the A embedding and the second receives the B embedding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows A and 50% of the time it is a random sentence, which is done for the \"next sentence prediction\" task. They are sampled such that the combined length is ≤ 512 tokens. The LM masking is applied after WordPiece tokenization with a uniform masking rate of 15%, and no special consideration given to partial word pieces. We train with batch size of 256 sequences (256 sequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch) for 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40 epochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus. We use Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, β 1 = 0.9, β 2 = 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning rate warmup over the first 10,000 steps, and linear decay of the learning rate. We use a dropout probability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu activation <ref target=\"#b18\" type=\"bibr\">(Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016)</ref> rather than the standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The training loss is the sum of the mean masked LM likelihood and the mean next sentence prediction likelihood.</p><p>Training of BERT BASE was performed on 4 Cloud TPUs in Pod configuration (16 TPU chips total). <ref type=\"bibr\">13</ref> Training of BERT LARGE was performed on 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pretraining took 4 days to complete.</p><p>Longer sequences are disproportionately expensive because attention is quadratic to the sequence length. To speed up pretraing in our experiments, we pre-train the model with sequence length of 128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest 10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the positional embeddings.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>A.3 Fine-tuning Procedure</head><p>For fine-tuning, most model hyperparameters are the same as in pre-training, with the exception of the batch size, learning rate, and number of training epochs. The dropout probability was always kept at 0.1. The optimal hyperparameter values are task-specific, but we found the following range of possible values to work well across all tasks:</p><p>• Batch size: 16, 32 We also observed that large data sets (e.g., 100k+ labeled training examples) were far less sensitive to hyperparameter choice than small data sets. Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is reasonable to simply run an exhaustive search over the above parameters and choose the model that performs best on the development set.</p><p>A.4 Comparison of <ref type=\"bibr\">BERT, ELMo ,and</ref> OpenAI GPT</p><p>Here we studies the differences in recent popular representation learning models including ELMo, OpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons between the model architectures are shown visually in Figure <ref type=\"figure\">3</ref>. Note that in addition to the architecture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are finetuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach.</p><p>The most comparable existing pre-training method to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a left-to-right Transformer LM on a large text corpus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT were intentionally made to make it as close to GPT as possible so that the two methods could be minimally compared. The core argument of this work is that the bi-directionality and the two pretraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for the majority of the empirical improvements, but we do note that there are several other differences between how BERT and GPT were trained:</p><p>• GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M words); BERT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M words).</p><p>• GPT uses a sentence separator ( • GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch size of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for 1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.</p><p>• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for all fine-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a task-specific fine-tuning learning rate which performs the best on the development set.</p><p>To isolate the effect of these differences, we perform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which demonstrate that the majority of the improvements are in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks and the bidirectionality they enable.</p></div>\n",

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>C.2 Ablation for Different Masking Procedures</head><p>In Section 3.1, we mention that BERT uses a mixed strategy for masking the target tokens when pre-training with the masked language model (MLM) objective. The following is an ablation study to evaluate the effect of different masking strategies. Note that the purpose of the masking strategies is to reduce the mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning, as the [MASK] symbol never appears during the fine-tuning stage. We report the Dev results for both MNLI and NER. For NER, we report both fine-tuning and feature-based approaches, as we expect the mismatch will be amplified for the feature-based approach as the model will not have the chance to adjust the representations.  The results are presented in Table <ref target=\"#tab_21\" type=\"table\">8</ref>. In the table, MASK means that we replace the target token with the [MASK] symbol for MLM; SAME means that we keep the target token as is; RND means that we replace the target token with another random token.</p><p>The numbers in the left part of the table represent the probabilities of the specific strategies used during MLM pre-training (BERT uses 80%, 10%, 10%). The right part of the paper represents the Dev set results. For the feature-based approach, we concatenate the last 4 layers of BERT as the features, which was shown to be the best approach in Section 5.3.</p><p>From the table it can be seen that fine-tuning is surprisingly robust to different masking strategies. However, as expected, using only the MASK strategy was problematic when applying the featurebased approach to NER. Interestingly, using only the RND strategy performs much worse than our strategy as well.</p></div><figure xml:id=\"fig_0\" xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: BERT input representation.

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"1\">Introduction</head><p>Many current NLP systems and techniques treat words as atomic units -there is no notion of similarity between words, as these are represented as indices in a vocabulary. This choice has several good reasons -simplicity, robustness and the observation that simple models trained on huge amounts of data outperform complex systems trained on less data. An example is the popular N-gram model used for statistical language modeling -today, it is possible to train N-grams on virtually all available data (trillions of words <ref target=\"#b2\" type=\"bibr\">[3]</ref>).</p><p>However, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks. For example, the amount of relevant in-domain data for automatic speech recognition is limited -the performance is usually dominated by the size of high quality transcribed speech data (often just millions of words). In machine translation, the existing corpora for many languages contain only a few billions of words or less. Thus, there are situations where simple scaling up of the basic techniques will not result in any significant progress, and we have to focus on more advanced techniques.</p><p>With progress of machine learning techniques in recent years, it has become possible to train more complex models on much larger data set, and they typically outperform the simple models. Probably the most successful concept is to use distributed representations of words <ref target=\"#b9\" type=\"bibr\">[10]</ref>. For example, neural network based language models significantly outperform N-gram models <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">[1,</ref><ref target=\"#b26\" type=\"bibr\">27,</ref><ref target=\"#b16\" type=\"bibr\">17]</ref>.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"1.1\">Goals of the Paper</head><p>The main goal of this paper is to introduce techniques that can be used for learning high-quality word vectors from huge data sets with billions of words, and with millions of words in the vocabulary. As far as we know, none of the previously proposed architectures has been successfully trained on more than a few hundred of millions of words, with a modest dimensionality of the word vectors between 50 -100.</p><p>We use recently proposed techniques for measuring the quality of the resulting vector representations, with the expectation that not only will similar words tend to be close to each other, but that words can have multiple degrees of similarity <ref target=\"#b19\" type=\"bibr\">[20]</ref>. This has been observed earlier in the context of inflectional languages -for example, nouns can have multiple word endings, and if we search for similar words in a subspace of the original vector space, it is possible to find words that have similar endings <ref target=\"#b12\" type=\"bibr\">[13,</ref><ref target=\"#b13\" type=\"bibr\">14]</ref>. Somewhat surprisingly, it was found that similarity of word representations goes beyond simple syntactic regularities. Using a word offset technique where simple algebraic operations are performed on the word vectors, it was shown for example that vector(\"King\") -vector(\"Man\") + vector(\"Woman\") results in a vector that is closest to the vector representation of the word Queen <ref target=\"#b19\" type=\"bibr\">[20]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we try to maximize accuracy of these vector operations by developing new model architectures that preserve the linear regularities among words. We design a new comprehensive test set for measuring both syntactic and semantic regularities <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">1</ref> , and show that many such regularities can be learned with high accuracy. Moreover, we discuss how training time and accuracy depends on the dimensionality of the word vectors and on the amount of the training data.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"1.2\">Previous Work</head><p>Representation of words as continuous vectors has a long history <ref target=\"#b9\" type=\"bibr\">[10,</ref><ref target=\"#b25\" type=\"bibr\">26,</ref><ref target=\"#b7\" type=\"bibr\">8]</ref>. A very popular model architecture for estimating neural network language model (NNLM) was proposed in <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">[1]</ref>, where a feedforward neural network with a linear projection layer and a non-linear hidden layer was used to learn jointly the word vector representation and a statistical language model. This work has been followed by many others.</p><p>Another interesting architecture of NNLM was presented in <ref target=\"#b12\" type=\"bibr\">[13,</ref><ref target=\"#b13\" type=\"bibr\">14]</ref>, where the word vectors are first learned using neural network with a single hidden layer. The word vectors are then used to train the NNLM. Thus, the word vectors are learned even without constructing the full NNLM. In this work, we directly extend this architecture, and focus just on the first step where the word vectors are learned using a simple model.</p><p>It was later shown that the word vectors can be used to significantly improve and simplify many NLP applications <ref target=\"#b3\" type=\"bibr\">[4,</ref><ref target=\"#b4\" type=\"bibr\">5,</ref><ref target=\"#b28\" type=\"bibr\">29]</ref>. Estimation of the word vectors itself was performed using different model architectures and trained on various corpora <ref target=\"#b3\" type=\"bibr\">[4,</ref><ref target=\"#b28\" type=\"bibr\">29,</ref><ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">23,</ref><ref target=\"#b18\" type=\"bibr\">19,</ref><ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">9]</ref>, and some of the resulting word vectors were made available for future research and comparison 2 . However, as far as we know, these architectures were significantly more computationally expensive for training than the one proposed in <ref target=\"#b12\" type=\"bibr\">[13]</ref>, with the exception of certain version of log-bilinear model where diagonal weight matrices are used <ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">[23]</ref>.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"2\">Model Architectures</head><p>Many different types of models were proposed for estimating continuous representations of words, including the well-known Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"2.1\">Feedforward Neural Net Language Model (NNLM)</head><p>The probabilistic feedforward neural network language model has been proposed in <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">[1]</ref>. It consists of input, projection, hidden and output layers. At the input layer, N previous words are encoded using 1-of-V coding, where V is size of the vocabulary. The input layer is then projected to a projection layer P that has dimensionality N × D, using a shared projection matrix. As only N inputs are active at any given time, composition of the projection layer is a relatively cheap operation.</p><p>The NNLM architecture becomes complex for computation between the projection and the hidden layer, as values in the projection layer are dense. For a common choice of N = 10, the size of the projection layer (P ) might be 500 to 2000, while the hidden layer size H is typically 500 to 1000 units. Moreover, the hidden layer is used to compute probability distribution over all the words in the vocabulary, resulting in an output layer with dimensionality V . Thus, the computational complexity per each training example is</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_1\">Q = N × D + N × D × H + H × V,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the dominating term is H × V . However, several practical solutions were proposed for avoiding it; either using hierarchical versions of the softmax <ref target=\"#b24\" type=\"bibr\">[25,</ref><ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">23,</ref><ref target=\"#b17\" type=\"bibr\">18]</ref>, or avoiding normalized models completely by using models that are not normalized during training <ref target=\"#b3\" type=\"bibr\">[4,</ref><ref target=\"#b8\" type=\"bibr\">9]</ref>. With binary tree representations of the vocabulary, the number of output units that need to be evaluated can go down to around log 2 (V ). Thus, most of the complexity is caused by the term N × D × H.</p><p>In our models, we use hierarchical softmax where the vocabulary is represented as a Huffman binary tree. This follows previous observations that the frequency of words works well for obtaining classes in neural net language models <ref target=\"#b15\" type=\"bibr\">[16]</ref>. Huffman trees assign short binary codes to frequent words, and this further reduces the number of output units that need to be evaluated: while balanced binary tree would require log 2 (V ) outputs to be evaluated, the Huffman tree based hierarchical softmax requires only about log 2 (U nigram perplexity(V )). For example when the vocabulary size is one million words, this results in about two times speedup in evaluation. While this is not crucial speedup for neural network LMs as the computational bottleneck is in the N ×D ×H term, we will later propose architectures that do not have hidden layers and thus depend heavily on the efficiency of the softmax normalization.</p></div>\n",

The main observation from the previous section was that most of the complexity is caused by the non-linear hidden layer in the model. While this is what makes neural networks so attractive, we decided to explore simpler models that might not be able to represent the data as precisely as neural networks, but can possibly be trained on much more data efficiently.</p><p>The new architectures directly follow those proposed in our earlier work <ref target=\"#b12\" type=\"bibr\">[13,</ref><ref target=\"#b13\" type=\"bibr\">14]</ref>, where it was found that neural network language model can be successfully trained in two steps: first, continuous word vectors are learned using simple model, and then the N-gram NNLM is trained on top of these distributed representations of words.

We call this architecture a bag-of-words model as the order of words in the history does not influence the projection. Furthermore, we also use words from the future; we have obtained the best performance on the task introduced in the next section by building a log-linear classifier with four future and four history words at the input, where the training criterion is to correctly classify the current (middle) word.</p><p>Training complexity is then</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_3\">Q = N × D + D × log 2 (V ).<label>(4)</label></formula><p>We denote this model further as CBOW, as unlike standard bag-of-words model, it uses continuous distributed representation of the context.

More precisely, we use each current word as an input to a log-linear classifier with continuous projection layer, and predict words within a certain range before and after the current word. We found that increasing the range improves quality of the resulting word vectors, but it also increases the computational complexity. Since the more distant words are usually less related to the current word than those close to it, we give less weight to the distant words by sampling less from those words in our training examples.</p><p>The training complexity of this architecture is proportional to</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_4\">Q = C × (D + D × log 2 (V )), (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id=\"formula_5\">)</formula><p>where C is the maximum distance of the words.

Although it is easy to show that word France is similar to Italy and perhaps some other countries, it is much more challenging when subjecting those vectors in a more complex similarity task, as follows. We follow previous observation that there can be many different types of similarities between words, for example, word big is similar to bigger in the same sense that small is similar to smaller. Example of another type of relationship can be word pairs big -biggest and small -smallest <ref target=\"#b19\" type=\"bibr\">[20]</ref>. We further denote two pairs of words with the same relationship as a question, as we can ask: \"What is the word that is similar to small in the same sense as biggest is similar to big?\"</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, these questions can be answered by performing simple algebraic operations with the vector representation of words. To find a word that is similar to small in the same sense as biggest is similar to big, we can simply compute vector X = vector(\"biggest\") − vector(\"big\") + vector(\"small\"). Then, we search in the vector space for the word closest to X measured by cosine distance, and use it as the answer to the question (we discard the input question words during this search). When the word vectors are well trained, it is possible to find the correct answer (word smallest) using this method.</p><p>Finally, we found that when we train high dimensional word vectors on a large amount of data, the resulting vectors can be used to answer very subtle semantic relationships between words, such as a city and the country it belongs to, e.g. France is to Paris as Germany is to Berlin. Word vectors with such semantic relationships could be used to improve many existing NLP applications, such as machine translation, information retrieval and question answering systems, and may enable other future applications yet to be invented. </p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"4.1\">Task Description</head><p>To measure quality of the word vectors, we define a comprehensive test set that contains five types of semantic questions, and nine types of syntactic questions. Two examples from each category are shown in Table <ref target=\"#tab_0\" type=\"table\">1</ref>. Overall, there are 8869 semantic and 10675 syntactic questions. The questions in each category were created in two steps: first, a list of similar word pairs was created manually.</p><p>Then, a large list of questions is formed by connecting two word pairs. For example, we made a list of 68 large American cities and the states they belong to, and formed about 2.5K questions by picking two word pairs at random. We have included in our test set only single token words, thus multi-word entities are not present (such as New York).</p><p>We evaluate the overall accuracy for all question types, and for each question type separately (semantic, syntactic). Question is assumed to be correctly answered only if the closest word to the vector computed using the above method is exactly the same as the correct word in the question; synonyms are thus counted as mistakes. This also means that reaching 100% accuracy is likely to be impossible, as the current models do not have any input information about word morphology. However, we believe that usefulness of the word vectors for certain applications should be positively correlated with this accuracy metric. Further progress can be achieved by incorporating information about structure of words, especially for the syntactic questions.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"4.2\">Maximization of Accuracy</head><p>We have used a Google News corpus for training the word vectors. This corpus contains about 6B tokens. We have restricted the vocabulary size to 1 million most frequent words. Clearly, we are facing time constrained optimization problem, as it can be expected that both using more data and higher dimensional word vectors will improve the accuracy. To estimate the best choice of model architecture for obtaining as good as possible results quickly, we have first evaluated models trained on subsets of the training data, with vocabulary restricted to the most frequent 30k words.</p><p>The results using the CBOW architecture with different choice of word vector dimensionality and increasing amount of the training data are shown in Table <ref type=\"table\">2</ref>.</p><p>It can be seen that after some point, adding more dimensions or adding more training data provides diminishing improvements. So, we have to increase both vector dimensionality and the amount of the training data together. While this observation might seem trivial, it must be noted that it is currently popular to train word vectors on relatively large amounts of data, but with insufficient size (such as 50 -100). Given Equation <ref target=\"#formula_3\" type=\"formula\">4</ref>, increasing amount of training data twice results in about the same increase of computational complexity as increasing vector size twice.</p><p>For the experiments reported in Tables <ref target=\"#tab_2\" type=\"table\">2 and 4</ref>, we used three training epochs with stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation. We chose starting learning rate 0.025 and decreased it linearly, so that it approaches zero at the end of the last training epoch.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"4.3\">Comparison of Model Architectures</head><p>First we compare different model architectures for deriving the word vectors using the same training data and using the same dimensionality of 640 of the word vectors. In the further experiments, we use full set of questions in the new Semantic-Syntactic Word Relationship test set, i.e. unrestricted to the 30k vocabulary. We also include results on a test set introduced in <ref target=\"#b19\" type=\"bibr\">[20]</ref> that focuses on syntactic similarity between words 3 .</p><p>The training data consists of several LDC corpora and is described in detail in <ref target=\"#b17\" type=\"bibr\">[18]</ref> (320M words, 82K vocabulary). We used these data to provide a comparison to a previously trained recurrent neural network language model that took about 8 weeks to train on a single CPU. We trained a feedforward NNLM with the same number of 640 hidden units using the DistBelief parallel training <ref target=\"#b5\" type=\"bibr\">[6]</ref>, using a history of 8 previous words (thus, the NNLM has more parameters than the RNNLM, as the projection layer has size 640 × 8).</p><p>In Table <ref type=\"table\">3</ref>, it can be seen that the word vectors from the RNN (as used in <ref target=\"#b19\" type=\"bibr\">[20]</ref>) perform well mostly on the syntactic questions. The NNLM vectors perform significantly better than the RNN -this is not surprising, as the word vectors in the RNNLM are directly connected to a non-linear hidden layer. The CBOW architecture works better than the NNLM on the syntactic tasks, and about the same on the semantic one. Finally, the Skip-gram architecture works slightly worse on the syntactic task than the CBOW model (but still better than the NNLM), and much better on the semantic part of the test than all the other models.</p><p>Next, we evaluated our models trained using one CPU only and compared the results against publicly available word vectors. The comparison is given in Table <ref target=\"#tab_2\" type=\"table\">4</ref>. The CBOW model was trained on subset  For experiments reported further, we used just one training epoch (again, we decrease the learning rate linearly so that it approaches zero at the end of training). Training a model on twice as much data using one epoch gives comparable or better results than iterating over the same data for three epochs, as is shown in Table <ref target=\"#tab_3\" type=\"table\">5</ref>, and provides additional small speedup.</p></div>\n",

We follow the approach described above: the relationship is defined by subtracting two word vectors, and the result is added to another word. Thus for example, Paris -France + Italy = Rome. As it can be seen, accuracy is quite good, although there is clearly a lot of room for further improvements (note that using our accuracy metric that  <ref target=\"#tab_5\" type=\"table\">8</ref> would score only about 60%). We believe that word vectors trained on even larger data sets with larger dimensionality will perform significantly better, and will enable the development of new innovative applications. Another way to improve accuracy is to provide more than one example of the relationship. By using ten examples instead of one to form the relationship vector (we average the individual vectors together), we have observed improvement of accuracy of our best models by about 10% absolutely on the semantic-syntactic test.</p><p>It is also possible to apply the vector operations to solve different tasks. For example, we have observed good accuracy for selecting out-of-the-list words, by computing average vector for a list of words, and finding the most distant word vector. This is a popular type of problems in certain human intelligence tests. Clearly, there is still a lot of discoveries to be made using these techniques.</p></div>\n",

We observed that it is possible to train high quality word vectors using very simple model architectures, compared to the popular neural network models (both feedforward and recurrent). Because of the much lower computational complexity, it is possible to compute very accurate high dimensional word vectors from a much larger data set.</p><p>Using the DistBelief distributed framework, it should be possible to train the CBOW and Skip-gram models even on corpora with one trillion words, for basically unlimited size of the vocabulary. That is several orders of magnitude larger than the best previously published results for similar models.</p><p>An interesting task where the word vectors have recently been shown to significantly outperform the previous state of the art is the SemEval-2012 Task 2 <ref target=\"#b10\" type=\"bibr\">[11]</ref>. The publicly available RNN vectors were used together with other techniques to achieve over 50% increase in Spearman's rank correlation over the previous best result <ref target=\"#b30\" type=\"bibr\">[31]</ref>. The neural network based word vectors were previously applied to many other NLP tasks, for example sentiment analysis <ref target=\"#b11\" type=\"bibr\">[12]</ref> and paraphrase detection <ref target=\"#b27\" type=\"bibr\">[28]</ref>. It can be expected that these applications can benefit from the model architectures described in this paper.</p><p>Our ongoing work shows that the word vectors can be successfully applied to automatic extension of facts in Knowledge Bases, and also for verification of correctness of existing facts. Results from machine translation experiments also look very promising. In the future, it would be also interesting to compare our techniques to Latent Relational Analysis <ref target=\"#b29\" type=\"bibr\">[30]</ref> and others.

In light of the success of these broad-coverage models, we investigate whether it is still helpful to tailor a pretrained model to the domain of a target task. We present a study across four domains (biomedical and computer science publications, news, and reviews) and eight classification tasks, showing that a second phase of pretraining indomain (domain-adaptive pretraining) leads to performance gains, under both high-and low-resource settings. Moreover, adapting to the task's unlabeled data (task-adaptive pretraining) improves performance even after domain-adaptive pretraining. Finally, we show that adapting to a task corpus augmented using simple data selection strategies is an effective alternative, especially when resources for domain-adaptive pretraining might be unavailable. Overall, we consistently find that multiphase adaptive pretraining offers large gains in task performance.</p></div>\n",

For instance, ROBERTA  was trained on over 160GB of uncompressed text, with sources ranging from Englishlanguage encyclopedic and news articles, to literary works and web content. Representations learned by such models achieve strong performance across many tasks with datasets of varying sizes drawn from a variety of sources (e.g., <ref target=\"#b58\" type=\"bibr\">Wang et al., 2018</ref>. This leads us to ask whether a tasks textual domain-a term typically used to denote a distribution over language characterizing a given topic or genre (such as \"science\" or \"mystery novels\")-is still relevant. Do the latest large pretrained models work universally or is it still helpful to build Figure <ref type=\"figure\">1</ref>: An illustration of data distributions. Task data is comprised of an observable task distribution, usually non-randomly sampled from a wider distribution (light grey ellipsis) within an even larger target domain, which is not necessarily one of the domains included in the original LM pretraining domain -though overlap is possible. We explore the benefits of continued pretraining on data from the task distribution and the domain distribution.</p><p>separate pretrained models for specific domains?</p><p>While some studies have shown the benefit of continued pretraining on domain-specific unlabeled data (e.g., , these studies only consider a single domain at a time and use a language model that is pretrained on a smaller and less diverse corpus than the most recent language models. Moreover, it is not known how the benefit of continued pretraining may vary with factors like the amount of available labeled task data, or the proximity of the target domain to the original pretraining corpus (see Figure <ref type=\"figure\">1</ref>).</p><p>We address this question for one such highperforming model, ROBERTA ) ( §2). We consider four domains (biomedical and computer science publications, news, and reviews; §3) and eight classification tasks (two in each domain). For targets that are not already in-domain for ROBERTA, our experiments show that contin-ued pretraining on the domain (which we refer to as domain-adaptive pretraining or DAPT) consistently improves performance on tasks from the target domain, in both high-and low-resource settings.</p><p>Above, we consider domains defined around genres and forums, but it is also possible to induce a domain from a given corpus used for a task, such as the one used in supervised training of a model. This raises the question of whether pretraining on a corpus more directly tied to the task can further improve performance. We study how domainadaptive pretraining compares to task-adaptive pretraining, or TAPT, on a smaller but directly taskrelevant corpus: the unlabeled task dataset ( §4), drawn from the task distribution. Task-adaptive pretraining has been shown effective <ref target=\"#b21\" type=\"bibr\">(Howard and Ruder, 2018)</ref>, but is not typically used with the most recent models. We find that TAPT provides a large performance boost for ROBERTA, with or without domain-adaptive pretraining.</p><p>Finally, we show that the benefits from taskadaptive pretraining increase when we have additional unlabeled data from the task distribution that has been manually curated by task designers or annotators. Inspired by this success, we propose ways to automatically select additional task-relevant unlabeled text, and show how this improves performance in certain low-resource cases ( §5). On all tasks, our results using adaptive pretraining techniques are competitive with the state of the art.</p><p>In summary, our contributions include:</p><p>• a thorough analysis of domain-and taskadaptive pretraining across four domains and eight tasks, spanning low-and high-resource settings; • an investigation into the transferability of adapted LMs across domains and tasks; and • a study highlighting the importance of pretraining on human-curated datasets, and a simple data selection strategy to automatically approach this performance. Our code as well as pretrained models for multiple domains and tasks are publicly available. 1</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"2\">Background: Pretraining</head><p>Learning for most NLP research systems since 2018 consists of training in two stages. First, a neural language model (LM), often with millions of parameters, is trained on large unlabeled cor-pora. The word (or wordpiece; <ref target=\"#b62\" type=\"bibr\">Wu et al. 2016)</ref> representations learned in the pretrained model are then reused in supervised training for a downstream task, with optional updates (fine-tuning) of the representations and network from the first stage.</p><p>One such pretrained LM is ROBERTA , which uses the same transformerbased architecture <ref target=\"#b56\" type=\"bibr\">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> as its predecessor, BERT . It is trained with a masked language modeling objective (i.e., cross-entropy loss on predicting randomly masked tokens). The unlabeled pretraining corpus for ROBERTA contains over 160 GB of uncompressed raw text from different English-language corpora (see Appendix §A.1). ROBERTA attains better performance on an assortment of tasks than its predecessors, making it our baseline of choice.</p><p>Although ROBERTA's pretraining corpus is derived from multiple sources, it has not yet been established if these sources are diverse enough to generalize to most of the variation in the English language. In other words, we would like to understand what is out of ROBERTA's domain. Towards this end, we explore further adaptation by continued pretraining of this large LM into two categories of unlabeled data: (i) large corpora of domain-specific text ( §3), and (ii) available unlabeled data associated with a given task ( §4).</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3\">Domain-Adaptive Pretraining</head><p>Our approach to domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) is straightforward-we continue pretraining ROBERTA on a large corpus of unlabeled domain-specific text. The four domains we focus on are biomedical (BIOMED) papers, computer science (CS) papers, newstext from REALNEWS, and AMAZON reviews. We choose these domains because they have been popular in previous work, and datasets for text classification are available in each. Table <ref target=\"#tab_1\" type=\"table\">1</ref> lists the specifics of the unlabeled datasets in all four domains, as well as ROBERTA's training corpus. 1</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.1\">Analyzing Domain Similarity</head><p>Before performing DAPT, we attempt to quantify the similarity of the target domain to ROBERTA's pretraining domain. We consider domain vocabularies containing the top 10K most frequent unigrams (excluding stopwords) in comparably sized   <ref target=\"#b4\" type=\"bibr\">Beltagy et al. (2020)</ref>. For RCT, we represent all sentences in one long sequence for simultaneous prediction.</p><p>Baseline As our baseline, we use an off-the-shelf ROBERTA-base model and perform supervised fine-tuning of its parameters for each classification task. On average, ROBERTA is not drastically behind the state of the art (details in Appendix §A.2), and serves as a good baseline since it provides a single LM to adapt to different domains.</p><p>Classification Architecture Following standard practice  we pass the final layer [CLS] token representation to a task-specific feedforward layer for prediction (see Table <ref target=\"#tab_1\" type=\"table\">14</ref>  Table <ref type=\"table\">2</ref>: Specifications of the various target task datasets. † indicates high-resource settings. Sources: CHEMPROT <ref target=\"#b30\" type=\"bibr\">(Kringelum et al., 2016)</ref>, RCT <ref target=\"#b11\" type=\"bibr\">(Dernoncourt and Lee, 2017)</ref>, ACL-ARC <ref target=\"#b24\" type=\"bibr\">(Jurgens et al., 2018)</ref>, SCIERC <ref target=\"#b36\" type=\"bibr\">(Luan et al., 2018)</ref>, HYPERPARTISAN <ref target=\"#b26\" type=\"bibr\">(Kiesel et al., 2019)</ref>, AGNEWS <ref target=\"#b68\" type=\"bibr\">(Zhang et al., 2015)</ref>, HELPFULNESS <ref target=\"#b38\" type=\"bibr\">(McAuley et al., 2015)</ref>, IMDB <ref target=\"#b37\" type=\"bibr\">(Maas et al., 2011</ref>  ments over ROBERTA, demonstrating the benefit of DAPT when the target domain is more distant from ROBERTA's source domain. The pattern is consistent across high-and low-resource settings. Although DAPT does not increase performance on AGNEWS, the benefit we observe in HYPERPAR-TISAN suggests that DAPT may be useful even for tasks that align more closely with ROBERTA's source domain.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.3\">Domain Relevance for DAPT</head><p>Additionally, we compare DAPT against a setting where for each task, we adapt the LM to a domain outside the domain of interest. This controls for the case in which the improvements over ROBERTA might be attributed simply to exposure to more data, regardless of the domain. In this setting, for NEWS, we use a CS LM; for REVIEWS, a BIOMED LM; for CS, a NEWS LM; for BIOMED, a REVIEWS LM. We use the vocabulary overlap statistics in Figure <ref type=\"figure\">2</ref> to guide these choices.</p><p>Our results are shown in Table <ref target=\"#tab_4\" type=\"table\">3</ref>, where the last column (¬DAPT) corresponds to this setting. For each task, DAPT significantly outperforms adapting to an irrelevant domain, suggesting the importance of pretraining on domain-relevant data. Furthermore, we generally observe that ¬DAPT results in worse performance than even ROBERTA on end-tasks. Taken together, these results indicate that in most settings, exposure to more data without considering domain relevance is detrimental to end-task performance. However, there are two tasks (SCIERC and ACL-ARC) in which ¬DAPT marginally improves performance over ROBERTA. This may suggest that in some cases, continued pretraining on any additional data is useful, as noted in <ref target=\"#b2\" type=\"bibr\">Baevski et al. (2019)</ref>.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.4\">Domain Overlap</head><p>Our analysis of DAPT is based on prior intuitions about how task data is assigned to specific domains. For instance, to perform DAPT for HELPFULNESS, we only adapt to AMAZON reviews, but not to any REALNEWS articles. However, the gradations in Figure <ref type=\"figure\">2</ref> suggest that the boundaries between domains are in some sense fuzzy; for example, 40% of unigrams are shared between REVIEWS and NEWS. As further indication of this overlap, we also qualitatively identify documents that overlap cross-domain: in Table <ref target=\"#tab_6\" type=\"table\">4</ref>, we showcase reviews and REALNEWS articles that are similar to these reviews (other examples can be found in Appendix §D).

Anyway, if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940 's, you'll find The Shop Around the Corner to be nothing short of wonderful. Just as good with repeat viewings.  Although this analysis is by no means comprehensive, it indicates that the factors that give rise to observable domain differences are likely not mutually exclusive. It is possible that pretraining beyond conventional domain boundaries could result in more effective DAPT; we leave this investigation to future work. In general, the provenance of data, including the processes by which corpora are curated, must be kept in mind when designing pretraining procedures and creating new benchmarks that test out-of-domain generalization abilities.</p></div>\n",

Compared to domainadaptive pretraining (DAPT; §3), the task-adaptive approach strikes a different trade-off: it uses a far smaller pretraining corpus, but one that is much more task-relevant (under the assumption that the training set represents aspects of the task well). This makes TAPT much less expensive to run than DAPT, and as we show in our experiments, the performance of TAPT is often competitive with that of DAPT.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"4.1\">Experiments</head><p>Similar to DAPT, task-adaptive pretraining consists of a second phase of pretraining ROBERTA, but only on the available task-specific training data. In contrast to DAPT, which we train for 12.5K steps, we perform TAPT for 100 epochs. We artificially augment each dataset by randomly masking different words (using the masking probability of 0.15) across epochs. As in our DAPT experiments, we pass the final layer [CLS] token representation to a task-specific feedforward layer for classification (see Table <ref target=\"#tab_1\" type=\"table\">14</ref> in Appendix for more hyperparameter details).</p><p>Our results are shown in the TAPT column of Table 5. TAPT consistently improves the ROBERTA baseline for all tasks across domains. Even on the news domain, which was part of ROBERTA pretraining corpus, TAPT improves over ROBERTA, showcasing the advantage of task adaptation. Particularly remarkable are the relative differences between TAPT and DAPT. DAPT is more resource intensive (see Table <ref target=\"#tab_15\" type=\"table\">9</ref> in §5.3), but TAPT manages to match its performance in some of the tasks, such as SCIERC. In RCT, HYPERPARTISAN, AGNEWS, HELPFULNESS, and IMDB, the results even exceed those of DAPT, highlighting the efficacy of this cheaper adaptation technique.    <ref target=\"#tab_8\" type=\"table\">5</ref>), it is harmful when applied across tasks. These findings illustrate differences in task distributions within a domain.</p><p>Combined DAPT and TAPT We investigate the effect of using both adaptation techniques together. We begin with ROBERTA and apply DAPT then TAPT under this setting. The three phases of pretraining add up to make this the most computationally expensive of all our settings (see Table <ref target=\"#tab_15\" type=\"table\">9</ref>). As expected, combined domain-and task-adaptive pretraining achieves the best performance on all tasks (Table <ref target=\"#tab_8\" type=\"table\">5</ref>). 2</p><p>Overall, our results show that DAPT followed by TAPT achieves the best of both worlds of domain and task awareness, yielding the best performance. While we speculate that TAPT followed by DAPT would be susceptible to catastrophic forgetting of the task-relevant corpus <ref target=\"#b66\" type=\"bibr\">(Yogatama et al., 2019)</ref>, alternate methods of combining the procedures may result in better downstream performance. Future work may explore pretraining with a more sophisticated curriculum of domain and task distributions.</p></div>\n",
       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Cross-Task Transfer</head><p>We complete the comparison between DAPT and TAPT by exploring whether adapting to one task transfers to other tasks in the same domain. For instance, we further pretrain the LM using the RCT unlabeled data, fine-tune it with the CHEMPROT labeled data, and observe the effect. We refer to this setting as Transfer-TAPT. Our results for tasks in all four domains are shown in Table <ref target=\"#tab_9\" type=\"table\">6</ref>. We see that TAPT optimizes for single task performance, to the detriment of cross-task transfer. These results demonstrate that data distributions of tasks within a given domain might differ. Further, this could also explain why adapting only to a broad domain is not sufficient, and why TAPT after DAPT is effective.  typically curated by humans. We explore two scenarios. First, for three tasks (RCT, HYPERPARTISAN, and IMDB) we use this larger pool of unlabeled data from an available human-curated corpus ( §5.1). Next, we explore retrieving related unlabeled data for TAPT, from a large unlabeled in-domain corpus, for tasks where extra human-curated data is unavailable ( §5.2).</p></div>\n",

This corpus is then downsampled to collect annotations, based on the annotation budget. The larger unlabeled corpus is thus expected to have a similar distribution to the task's training data. Moreover, it is usually available. We explore the role of such corpora in task-adaptive pretraining.</p><p>Data We simulate a low-resource setting RCT-500, by downsampling the training data of the RCT dataset to 500 examples (out of 180K available), and treat the rest of the training data as unlabeled. The HYPERPARTISAN shared task <ref target=\"#b26\" type=\"bibr\">(Kiesel et al., 2019)</ref> has two tracks: low-and high-resource. We use 5K documents from the high-resource setting as Curated-TAPT unlabeled data and the original lowresource training documents for task fine-tuning.

Applying Curated-TAPT after adapting to the domain results in the largest boost in performance on all tasks; in HYPERPARTISAN, DAPT + Curated-TAPT is within standard deviation of Curated-TAPT. Moreover, curated-TAPT achieves Figure <ref type=\"figure\">3</ref>: An illustration of automated data selection ( §5.2). We map unlabeled CHEMPROT and 1M BIOMED sentences to a shared vector space using the VAMPIRE model trained on these sentences.

We propose simple unsuper-vised methods to retrieve unlabeled text that aligns with the task distribution, from a large in-domain corpus. Our approach finds task-relevant data from the domain by embedding text from both the task and domain in a shared space, then selects candidates from the domain based on queries using the task data. Importantly, the embedding method must be lightweight enough to embed possibly millions of sentences in a reasonable time. Given these constraints, we employ VAMPIRE <ref type=\"bibr\"/> Figure <ref type=\"figure\">3</ref>), a lightweight bag-of-words language model. We pretrain VAM-PIRE on a large deduplicated 3 sample of the domain (1M sentences) to obtain embeddings of the text from both the task and domain sample. We then select k candidates of each task sentence from the domain sample, in embeddings space. Candidates are selected (i) via nearest neighbors selection (kNN-TAPT) 4 , or (ii) randomly (RAND-TAPT). We continue pretraining ROBERTA on this augmented corpus with both the task data (as in TAPT) as well as the selected candidate pool.</p><p>Results Results in Table <ref target=\"#tab_13\" type=\"table\">8</ref> show that kNN-TAPT outperforms TAPT for all cases. RAND-TAPT is generally worse than kNN-TAPT, but within a standard deviation arising from 5 seeds for RCT and ACL-ARC. As we increase k, kNN-TAPT performance steadily increases, and approaches that of DAPT. Appendix F shows examples of nearest neighbors of task data. Future work might consider a closer study of kNN-TAPT, more sophisticated data selection methods, and the tradeoff between the diversity and task relevance of selected examples.</p></div>\n",

TAPT is nearly 60 times faster to train than DAPT on a single v3-8 TPU and storage requirements for DAPT on this task are 5.8M times that of TAPT. Our best setting of DAPT + TAPT amounts to three phases of pretraining, and at first glance appears to be very expensive. However, once the LM has been adapted to a broad domain, it can be reused for multiple tasks within that domain, with only a single additional TAPT phase per task. While Curated-TAPT tends to achieve the best cost-  benefit ratio in this comparison, one must also take into account the cost of curating large in-domain data.

While our results demonstrate how these approaches can improve ROBERTA, a powerful LM, the approaches we studied are general enough to be applied to any pretrained LM.

       " <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>IMDB review REALNEWS article</head><p>Spooks is enjoyable trash, featuring some well directed sequences, ridiculous plots and dialogue, and some third rate acting. Many have described this is a UK version of 24, and one can see the similarities. The American version shares the weak silly plots, but the execution is so much slicker, sexier and I suspect, expensive. Some people describe weak comedy as gentle comedy. This is gentle spy story hour, the exact opposite of anything created by John Le Carre. Give me Smiley any day.</p><p>[...] Remember poor Helen Flynn from Spooks? In 2002, the headlong BBC spy caper was in such a hurry to establish the high-wire stakes of its morally compromised world that Lisa Faulkners keen-as-mustard MI5 rookie turned out to be a lot more expendable than her prominent billing suggested. [...] Functioning as both a shocking twist and rather callous statement that No-One Is Safe, it gave the slick drama an instant patina of edginess while generating a record-breaking number of complaints.</p><p>[</p><p>The Sopranos is perhaps the most mind-opening series you could possibly ever want to watch. It's smart, it's quirky, it's funny -and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can't resist watching.</p><p>The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters, set in the subterranean world of the New York crime families.</p><p>For most of the time, you really don't know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back, or buy them lunch. Further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities -These are dangerous men, most of them murderers, but by God if you don't love them too. I've laughed at their wisecracks, been torn when they've made err in judgement, and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal. <ref type=\"bibr\">[...]</ref> The drumbeat regarding the Breaking Bad finale has led to the inevitable speculation on whether the final chapter in this serialized gem will live up to the hype or disappoint (thank you, Dexter, for setting that bar pretty low), with debate, second-guessing and graduate-thesis-length analysis sure to follow. The Most Memorable TV Series Finales of All-Time <ref type=\"bibr\">[...]</ref> No ending in recent years has been more divisive than The Sopranos for some, a brilliant flash (literally, in a way) of genius; for others (including yours truly), a too-cute copout, cryptically leaving its characters in perpetual limbo. The precedent to that would be St. Elsewhere, which irked many with its provocative, surreal notion that the whole series was, in fact, conjured in the mind of an autistic child.</p><p>[...]</p><p>The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, is by no means a good movie, but I can't really say it's one I regret watching. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie, like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where Cage is looking for the girl, has a hallucination, followed by another hallucination, followed by a dream sequence-with a hallucination, etc., but it's just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this. Instead, here's five reasons why you SHOULD watch The Wicker Man, even though it's bad: 5. It's hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it, the only problem is in its cheesy, unintentionally funny execution. If nothing else, this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film, or even read the short story on which it is based. 4. For a cheesy horror/thriller, it is really aesthetically pleasing. [...] NOTE: The Unrated version of the movie is the best to watch, and it's better to watch the Theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue, which features a cameo from James Franco.</p><p>[...] What did you ultimately feel about \"The Wicker Man\" movie when all was said and done? [...] Im a fan of the original and Im glad that I made the movie because they dont make movies like that anymore and probably the result of what \"Wicker Man\" did is the reason why they dont make movies like that anymore. Again, its kind of that 70s sensibility, but Im trying to do things that are outside the box. Sometimes that means itll work and other times it wont. Again though Im going to try and learn from anything that I do. I think that it was a great cast, and Neil La Bute is one of the easiest directors that Ive ever worked with. He really loves actors and he really gives you a relaxed feeling on the set, that you can achieve whatever it is that youre trying to put together, but at the end of the day the frustration that I had with The Wicker Man, which I think has been remedied on the DVD because I believe the DVD has the directors original cut, is that they cut the horror out of the horror film to try and get a PG-13 rating. I mean, I dont know how to stop something like that. So Im not happy with the way that the picture ended, but Im happy with the spirit with which it was made. [...]</p><p>Dr. Seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive. Cat in the Hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, big mistake! Myers proves he can't act in this film. He acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. The kids in this movie are all right, somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying. The story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never tweak with the original story! Bringing in the evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life. <ref type=\"bibr\">[...]</ref> The Cat in the Hat, <ref type=\"bibr\">[...]</ref> Based on the book by Dr. Seuss <ref type=\"bibr\">[...]</ref> From the moment his tall, red-and-white-striped hat appears at their door, Sally and her brother know that the Cat in the Hat is the most mischievous cat they will ever meet. Suddenly the rainy afternoon is transformed by the Cat and his antics. Will their house ever be the same? Can the kids clean up before mom comes home? With some tricks (and a fish) and Thing Two and Thing One, with the Cat in The Hat, the fun's never done!Dr. Seuss is known worldwide as the imaginative master of children's literature. His books include a wonderful blend of invented and actual words, and his rhymes have helped many children and adults learn and better their understanding of the English language. <ref type=\"bibr\">[...]</ref>   Neighbor 0 Of this group, 26% died after discharge from hospital, and the median time to death was 11 days (interquartile range, 4.0-15.0 days) after discharge.

By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions -something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art finetuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.</p></div>\n",

LoRA performs on-par or better than finetuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA. * Equal contribution. 0 Compared to V1, this draft includes better baselines, experiments on GLUE, and more on adapter latency. 1 While GPT-3 175B achieves non-trivial performance with few-shot learning, fine-tuning boosts its performance significantly as shown in Appendix A.</p></div>\n",

       "(' \\nWe introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a;Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications.BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n',\n",
       " ' \\nAs Transfer Learning from large-scale pre-trained models becomes more prevalent in Natural Language Processing (NLP), operating these large models in on-theedge and/or under constrained computational training or inference budgets remains challenging. In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller generalpurpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be finetuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study.\\n')"

Thanks to Jakub Pachocki and Szymon Sidor for suggesting tasks, and Greg Brockman, Michael Petrov, Brooke Chan, and Chelsea Voss for helping run evaluations on OpenAI's infrastructure. Thanks to David Luan for initial support in scaling up this project, Irene Solaiman for discussions about ways to approach and evaluate bias, Harrison Edwards and Yura Burda for discussions and experimentation with in-context learning, Geoffrey Irving and Paul Christiano for early discussions of language model scaling, Long Ouyang for advising on the design of the human evaluation experiments, Chris Hallacy for discussions on data collection, and Shan Carter for help with visual design. Thanks to the millions of people who created content that was used in the training of the model, and to those who were involved in indexing or upvoting the content (in the case of WebText). Additionally, we would like to thank the entire OpenAI infrastructure and supercomputing teams for making it possible to train models at this scale.\""
